    "Prompt engineering can be frustrating, especially when it comes to tasks where metrics are hard to defined. Crafting a prompt is often an iterative process, refining it over multiple examples.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will walk through \"prompt bootstrapping\", where you will iteratively refine a prompt by providing unstructured feedback over a dataset. Below is an overview of the process.\n",
