    "# RAG evaluation with RAGAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Ragas is a popular framework that helps you evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can integrate their excellent RAG metrics in LangSmith to evaluate your RAG app.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will grade a simple RAG application based on the following metrics. Most metrics use an LLM as a judge in some capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labeled generated metrics:**\n",
    "- `answer_correctness` - Is the response correct, based on the `ground_truth` response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference-free generator metrics:**\n",
    "- `faithfulness` - Proportion of claims in the response that are grounded in the retrieved context ([entailment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_entailment)-based).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference-free retriever metrics:**\n",
    "- `context_relevancy` - Proportion of retrieved sentences that are \"relevant\" to the user question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labeled retriever metrics:**\n",
    "- `context_recall` - Proportion of the _ground truth_ answer that can be attributed to the docs.\n",
    "- `context_precision` - Are the relevant docs (according to the _ground truth_) ranked higher? Works by scoring each document as useful in deducing the ground truth, computing precision @ K using that score for each K, then averaging over the total number of useful docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, you likely won't need to apply all of these metrics at the same time, but each metric can shed a bit of light on the different aspects of your retriever and generator setup."

She will assist you through the process and ensure that you receive any necessary documentation or support.\\n\\n3. **Gather Required Documentation**: You'll typically need your passport, proof of your ties to your home country (to show you will return after your visit), proof of the purpose of your trip, and financial means.\\n\\n4. **Fill Out Application and Schedule Interview**: Complete the visa application form (DS-160) online and schedule an interview appointment at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country. Pay the visa application fee if required.\\n\\n5. **Attend Your Visa Interview**: During the interview, a consular officer will determine whether you qualify for the visa. You may need to provide fingerprints and additional documentation.\\n\\nRemember, while 37signals will cover the cost of any documentation you need to travel on 37signals business, the process involves working closely with Andrea and preparing thoroughly for your interview and application.\",\n",

[Apply for an ESTA here](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/).\\\\n\\\\nCanadian passport holders don’t need a visa to enter the US for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are all that’s required.\\\\n\\\\n### B-1 Business Visitor Visa\\\\n\\\\nIf your country does not participate in the Visa Waiver Program or you are not eligible for an ESTA, you’ll need to apply for a B-1 business visitor visa… the long way.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll work with you through this process. Start early, as soon as we have dates for a meet-up or conference. Visa appointments and processing can take weeks to months. Ping Andrea as soon as you know that you’ll need a visa.\\\\n\\\\n### Trusted Traveler Programs\\\\n\\\\nCitizens of some countries are eligible for [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/frequently-asked-questions) and Canadians are eligible for [NEXUS](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus/nexus-eligibility). These programs are completely optional but may make life a little easier, at the cost of onerous biometric scans like fingerprinting (for Global Entry and NEXUS) and iris scanning (for NEXUS). Note: An ESTA is still required for travel; these programs just speed up entry.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to countries other than the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nThe visa requirements for your nationality will vary depending on the country you plan to visit, as individual visa policies and requirements vary for different foreign citizens. It may or may not be necessary to obtain a travel document to visit your country of destination.\\\\n\\\\nPlease check the requirements for your nationality with your destination country as far in advance of travel as you can. You can also use a [visa checker](https://www.onlinevisa.com/visa-requirements/). You may be able to travel visa-free, or you may need to obtain a visa, a waiver, or an electronic travel authorization.\\\\n\\\\n### Invitation Letter\\\\n\\\\nTo substantiate the purpose of your travel to any country, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you’re traveling on behalf of 37signals business. Verify in advance if the country you’re visiting *requires* a letter of purpose, and that you won’t need a work visa to accompany a letter.\\\\n\\\\n## Company Security at Border Crossings\\\\n\\\\nWhen you cross a border, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.\\\\n\\\\nWhat’s a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with source code; your tablet where you read work email; your phone where you use the Basecamp app; etc.\\\\n\\\\n### TL;DR: Don’t Travel With Work Data\\\\n\\\\n* If you don’t need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don’t bring it with you!\\\\n* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: Before You Travel\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the US.\\\\n* Update your electronic travel authorization with your travel info when you have it.\\\\n* Ensure you have your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.\\\\n* If you run into general travel issues while on 37signals business, contact Andrea.\\\\n* If you find yourself facing serious consequences like arrest or illegal detention in the United States, you can contact our attorney Jennifer Schaaf. Her contact information is in the teams vault in 1Password. You should also contact your home country’s embassy or consulate; please save that phone number prior to travel.\\\\n* If you’re traveling to a country with privacy laws that concern you, please raise that concern internally with Andrea before you travel so we can discuss putting protections in place, including connecting you with a local, on-call attorney.\\\\n* 1Password\\\\n  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn’t have any work logins. If it does, move them to the team vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the 37signals team which is perfect for those logins.\\\\n  * Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.\\\\n  * Open 1Password on each device you’re traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it’s in Travel Mode.\\\\n* HEY\\\\n  * [Log out of HEY on all sessions.](https://app.hey.com/my/sessions)\\\\n* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.\\\\n  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.\\\\n  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data\\\\n  * [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data. Check Cookies and site data; uncheck all the other items. > Clear data.\\\\n* Source code.\\\\n  * Make an encrypted archive on an external hard drive of your git repos so you can download and restore it after you’re through customs. Here are [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) for doing that if you’re running a Mac OS. Please perform an equally secure file encryption for Windows or Linux OS & check with SIP if you’re unsure how to do that.\\\\n  * Delete all source code from your laptop.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents.\\\\n  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup on your external drive and remove from your laptop. Please refrain from using iCloud for any files/repos.\\\\n* Dropbox\\\\n  * Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.\\\\n* Touch ID (optional)\\\\n  * Unlocking your device can be compelled at US border crossings, but other countries may be less intrusive, so it may make sense to make your device a little harder to unlock.\\\\n  * Disable Touch ID or Face ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: At Customs\\\\n\\\\n* Have ready your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details including the address of where you’ll be staying.\\\\n* Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.\\\\n* Common questions:\\\\n  * Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting in *city*.\\\\n  * Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with 37signals.\\\\n  * Where are you staying? Lodging name, address, phone number.\\\\n* Be straightforward and truthful. You’re legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Arrive\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know when you’ve arrived at your destination and have cleared airport security.\\\\n* Touch ID / Face ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Basecamp app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Disable Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you’ll have full access again.\\\\n* HEY: Log back in on your device(s).\\\\n* Source code: Download and restore the archive of your git repos, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Return\\\\n\\\\n* Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the US.\\\\n\\\\n## Any Questions?\\\\n\\\\nHitting a snag or have any questions?

Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Your First Few Days\\\\nBefore you start, Andrea will order you a new Apple laptop with the specs you request and any accessories you need like an external keyboard, mouse, or display. Get what you need, while keeping in mind the demands of your work when choosing specs.\\\\n\\\\nA day or two before you start, your manager will email you instructions for your first day. Your manager will be your point of contact for your early projects and activities. You’ll also work with a member of our Ops team who will help you as you set up all the accounts you need to work at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nOn your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called “Welcome, [your name]!”. Your welcome project will contain a few to-do lists, tailored to your role and linking to accounts or services that you need to set up. You’ll also see to-do lists that your Ops buddy and manager will be working through. Your Ops buddy and your manager will be in contact with you as you set up your environment, should you have questions or get stuck.\\\\n\\\\nTo keep everyone\\'s devices safe and secure, we manage all our Mac devices using [Kandji](https://kandji.io) as well as our in-house tool [Shipshape 🔒](https://github.com/basecamp/shipshape/).\\\\n\\\\nYour training schedules and [onboarding expectations](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/making-a-career.md#your-first-90-days) will be in your welcome project. You’ll also find docs with helpful links to technical documentation, walkthrough videos, important Basecamp projects, and more.\\\\n\\\\nYour welcome project will also contain a list of people to meet over the course of your first few weeks.\\\\n* your manager. You and your manager will meet on your first day to sort out a recurring 1:1 schedule and to review your specific onboarding expectations.\\\\n* your team. Most teams have a weekly call which you’ll join your first week.\\\\n* your 37signals buddy. Your buddy will be someone who’s not on your immediate team, who’s worked at 37signals for a while, and who can point you in the right direction when you have a question and don’t quite know where to turn. They’ll introduce themselves during your first week, to say hi and offer their help. They’ll check in with you periodically throughout your first couple months to see how you’re settling in.\\\\n* People Ops. You’ll meet with Andrea to review 37signals policies, benefits, and compensation.\\\\n\\\\nAfter your environment has been set up, expectations are clear, and you’ve met who you need to meet, you’ll get to work! You’ll begin working on real projects, with plenty of support and guidance, within your first week. Your responsibilities and impact will increase as you learn and gain confidence over the next few months, and most people are up to speed and feeling fully part of the team in about 3 months.\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.23648742364347014}',\n",
       "     '{\\'file\\': \\'benefits-and-perks.md\\', \\'content\\': \"# Benefits & Perks\\\\n\\\\n## Health Insurance\\\\nDetailed information about all 37signals insurance policies and other benefits can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/vaults/5060979274).\\\\n\\\\n### Medical Insurance\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, medical insurance is provided through Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. The company pays 75% of the premium and the employee pays the other 25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\nEach pay period, you’ll see a payroll deduction for medical insurance:\\\\n\\\\n* Employee-only medical coverage: $76.93\\\\n* Employee-partner medical coverage: $160.26\\\\n* Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $171.29\\\\n* Employee-family medical coverage: $254.61\\\\n\\\\n### Dental Insurance\\\\n\\\\nDental insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Vision Insurance\\\\n\\\\nVision insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Health Insurance for Staff Outside the US\\\\nIf you’re outside of the US and pay out of pocket for private health insurance, you can request reimbursement for 75% of your insurance payments on your monthly invoice. Your monthly reimbursement is capped at the amount 37signals pays per employee per month on the US employee group plan. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for reimbursement.\\\\n\\\\n### Life Insurance\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers a $400,000 life insurance/AD+D policy to all staff through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and it’s terminated automatically on your final day of employment. Open enrollment is in November every year, and participants are auto-enrolled at that time.\\\\n\\\\n## Retirement Plan\\\\n\\\\nOur retirement plan for US employees is with Vanguard. 37signals matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 6% of your salary. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan with your first paycheck.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re outside the US, 37signals will match what you contribute to a retirement account in your home country, up to 6% of your salary. In these cases, 37signals will pay you directly via your monthly invoice. It’s up to you to invest that payment and maintain administration of the retirement account and its taxes. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for a match.\\\\n\\\\n## Flexible Spending Account (FSA)\\\\n\\\\nThe FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $3,050/year. There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care, and the max for that plan is $5,000/year or $2,500/year if you split this with a partner. This is an entirely optional program. Open enrollment is in December every year, with new coverage beginning January 1. Both FSAs are with Paychex, our payroll provider.\\\\n\\\\n## Paid Time Off\\\\n\\\\n### Vacation Time\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers 18 days of paid time off plus [11 local holidays](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5061131347) every year. We ask that you [track your time off](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/projects/14971171). Your vacation time is prorated based on your start date during your first year at 37signals. Your vacation time rolls over year to year with a maximum bank of 27 days at any time. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals with vacation days in your bank, you’ll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (prorated at the time of your departure).\\\\n\\\\n### Sabbatical\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to annual PTO and holidays, every *three* years employees may take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Give your team a heads-up preferably three months in advance so they can coordinate. If you’re terminated or resign from 37signals with an unused sabbatical, 37signals will pay you the monetary equivalent of those unused days only if your unused sabbatical was earned within the previous 12 months.\\\\n\\\\n### Sick Time\\\\n\\\\nWe don’t offer a bank of sick days nor do we ask you to track your sick days. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to Personal Leave. 37signals does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination, since we have no sick time bank.\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures. If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your manager for accommodations.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you are unable to work for more than 1 week because of illness or injury, let your manager know as soon as you can. You can take four weeks off at 100% pay. If after 4 weeks, you’re still unable to work, your salary will drop to 70% for an additional 8 weeks. Your medical insurance will remain in force throughout your Leave. If after 12 weeks, you still cannot work, talk to your manager, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis. You may be asked to provide medical documentation to support your request for Personal Leave, and Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave per 12-month period.\\\\n\\\\n### Summer Hours\\\\n\\\\nWe work 4-day work weeks from May 1 through August 31 every year. An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible. When a holiday occurs during summer hours, you can take the holiday off *or* your normal summer day off. Any additional days off would count as vacation days.\\\\n\\\\n### Day of Service\\\\n\\\\n37signals also allows a Day of Service. You can take one day off every year to volunteer for a charitable or community organization of your choice. No need to use a vacation day or personal day, just let your team know you’ll be out. 37signals does not pay out for unused Days of Service if you resign or are terminated from 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n### Scheduling Time Off\\\\n\\\\n37signals doesn’t have a formal time off request process. It’s your responsibility to work with your manager and team to ensure coverage and manage your scheduled workload. The sooner you can inform your manager and team of your planned absence, the better, especially longer absences like sabbatical or long vacations. If your team has a defined process for scheduling time off, please follow that first.\\\\n\\\\nThe only time we ask you *not* to schedule discretionary time off is during a CODE. At 37signals, we assign a CODE when urgent work needs to be done. We have three levels of criticality. A CODE RED is an emergency, a CODE YELLOW is less immediate but still critical, and a CODE LAUNCH is called when we’re in the final stages of launching a new product. If we’re in the midst of one of these and you can delay your vacation or sabbatical until after the code has ended, please do.\\\\n\\\\n## Family Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you become the primary caregiver of a child, you can take up to 16 weeks leave at 100% pay. If you become the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% pay. You may choose to take an additional unpaid leave as the primary or secondary caregiver.\\\\n\\\\nSome states require us to provide additional [benefits](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/stateFMLA.md#new-york).\\\\n\\\\n## Bereavement Leave\\\\n\\\\nWhen you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.\\\\n\\\\nYou can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know you’ll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your manager to discuss that special case.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals EAP is through ComPsych, and it provides a *confidential* avenue for you to get assistance with issues regarding health, family, legal, financial, wellness or other personal matters. When you call or email ComPsych, you’ll be connected to a certified representative who can help you one-on-one at that time, or who can refer you to someone in your area for longer-term help. Services range from immediate or crisis mental health care to phone-help on your 401k investments to a referral to a lawyer in your area to help with your estate planning. Because we use the EAP, you also receive discounts on those referrals to professionals.\\\\n\\\\n## Pet Insurance\\\\n\\\\nFor your fur babies! 37signals doesn’t contribute to this plan at all, but everyone gets a 10% discount on this insurance you might otherwise buy. There are no set rates, and you can visit our portal on [Figo’s website](https://figopetinsurance.com) to get your quote and sign up. There’s no open enrollment period to sign up for pet insurance.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Profit Sharing\\\\n\\\\n37signals shares 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2022 profits distributed in March 2023).\\\\n\\\\nYou’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary at 37signals, and you’ll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nWe ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon, not something to be budgeted with, but as a true bonus. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount we’re able to share with employees may swing wildly or not be paid out at all.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Liquidity Pool\\\\n\\\\nThere are no plans to sell 37signals or take the company public! But, in the slight chance of that happening, employees may be eligible to receive a portion of 10% of the value of the company if 37signals is sold or made public. That 10% would be divided into shares, and shares distributed amongst employees based on their tenure at the time of the sale/offering.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees are eligible for shares in the liquidity pool after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary, and you max out your shares after 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Gifts\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of every year, 37signals gives a thank-you gift to employees. The gift changes year to year and is not intended to be a year-end bonus.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees also receive a thank-you gift on their anniversaries with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Home Office Set-up\\\\n\\\\nSince you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. During your first year at 37signals, you can expense up to $2,000 on things like a new desk, new desk chair, or other office furniture. This benefit expires on your first anniversary with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Coworking Space Stipend\\\\n\\\\nYou can expense up to $200/month towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space like Soho House.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone at 37signals has a subscription to [Deskpass](https://www.deskpass.com), a co-working desk reservation service. You can use Deskpass to find co-working spaces near you, and your $200/month benefit is pre-fixed in your account. You’re not required to use Deskpass to use your co-working space benefit. Your Deskpass budget is capped at $200/mo, but none of that gets paid out unless you book a desk.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal 37signals Accounts\\\\n\\\\nAll employees can have a free personal Basecamp account and a free personal HEY account. We\\'ll comp your existing accounts during your on-boarding process when you join the company. If you decide to sign up for either account later, you can comp the accounts in QueenBee so you won\\'t be charged. Ping Andrea or Support if you need help with that.\\\\n\\\\n## Expense Account\\\\n\\\\nAll staff carry a 37signals Visa card that you can use for work expenses like the benefits described above, software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies. Check with your manager or Andrea if you have any doubts about whether or not a purchase qualifies as a work expense.\\\\n\\\\nWe use an expense management platform called [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com/). You’re responsible for the monthly categorizing of your expenses and uploading receipts for purchases over $75. Full instructions on how to log your expenses in Airbase can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5508145768).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a meet-up flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of 37signals, we’ll buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a great day to celebrate).\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of conferences — please limit your attendance at professional conferences to once a year. Don’t extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule; you should be traveling specifically to attend the conf. Our conference budget guidelines mirror our mini meet-up budget guidelines; you can find those in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4347682694).\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.21893254132563464}',\n",
       "     '{\\'file\\': \\'managing-work-devices.md\\', \\'content\\': \"# Managing work devices\\\\n\\\\nEveryone receives a new Mac [when they join 37signals](https://basecamp.com/handbook/08-getting-started#your-first-few-days). We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you\\'re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n\\\\nThere are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we\\'ve produced [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.\", \\'similarity\\': 0.2110474253248295}',\n",
       "     \"{'file': 'where-we-work.md', 'content': '# Where We Work\\\\n\\\\n## From home\\\\n\\\\nMost people at 37signals work from home most of the time. You can spend up to $2,000 during your first year at 37signals outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.\\\\n\\\\n## From coffee shops\\\\n\\\\nWorking from home all the time isn’t everyone’s cup of coffee.

Here are the designer levels and their corresponding criteria:\\n\\n### Junior Designer\\n- Thoroughly reviewed work with substantial back-and-forth.\\n- Works primarily on tightly scoped, single-element, routine problems alongside another designer. Follows existing design patterns within the company's look and feel.\\n- Usually has less than 2 years of professional design experience.\\n- Capabilities include basic HTML/CSS (Web) and creating prototypes with static screens (Mobile).\\n\\n### Designer\\n- Work is reviewed with the occasional need for direction or changes.\\n- Works mostly on tightly scoped features, individual screens, or small problems with another designer.\\n- Typically has 2-5 years of professional design experience.\\n- Fully capable of writing modern HTML/CSS (Web) and creating basic prototypes demonstrating interactions and animations (Mobile).\\n\\n### Senior Designer\\n- Work does not necessarily need to be reviewed, but the general approach may be discussed.\\n- Can lead small batch projects from concept to shipping as the sole designer (alongside a programmer).\\n- Occasionally leads on large batch projects, sometimes with assistance.\\n- Generally has 5-8 years of professional design experience.\\n- Skills include writing modern HTML/CSS and basic Javascript proficiency (Web), and creating detailed interactive prototypes (Mobile).\\n\\n### Lead Designer\\n- Works autonomously without regular need for review.\\n- Can lead large batch projects from concept to shipping as the sole designer.\\n- May lead a small department or longer-term initiative.\\n- Maintains professional standards for the organization and contributes to the brand aesthetic.\\n- Typically has 8-12 years of design experience, with 3-5 years at 37signals.\\n- Fully capable in modern HTML/CSS/JS and can make moderate progress in Rails (Web).

       "     \"{'file': 'making-a-career.md', 'content': '# Making A Career\\\\n\\\\n## Your First 90 Days\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations! You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5432521841963529}\"],\n",

       "   'output': {'answer': \"Kandji is a centralized management and security system used by 37signals to handle the configuration and security of work devices, specifically Mac computers. This system plays a crucial role in reducing the exposure to security incidents by applying a standard configuration to every device. Here are the key ways Kandji assists with security and device management at 37signals:\\n\\n1. **Standard Configuration**: Kandji applies a standard set of configurations across all devices, including enabling disk encryption, setting up the firewall, and enforcing password rules. This ensures that all devices adhere to a baseline level of security, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.\\n\\n2. **Essential Apps Installation**: It automatically installs essential applications, such as EncryptMe, on every work device. These apps are crucial for maintaining security and privacy, especially when employees are accessing the internet or handling sensitive company data.\\n\\n3. **Security Updates**: Kandji ensures that all the installed apps, including security applications, have the latest updates applied. This is critical for protecting against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware or hackers.\\n\\n4. **Remote Wipe Capability**: In cases where a device is lost or an employee leaves the company, Kandji provides the ability to remotely wipe the device. This feature is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive company data and systems in the event of theft or loss.\\n\\nKandji is explicitly highlighted as a configuration management system, not a surveillance tool, meaning that it does not monitor or track employees’ activities on their work devices. Its primary purpose is to ensure that all work devices are secure and configured according to the company's security policies, allowing employees to access sensitive systems and data safely. \\n\\nOverall, Kandji helps 37signals maintain a secure and manageable IT environment, allowing employees to focus on their work with the assurance that their work devices are protected against common security threats.\",\n",

We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you\\'re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n\\\\nThere are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we\\'ve produced [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.\", \\'similarity\\': 0.6182683595740541}',\n",

They are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n### Dash\\\\n\\\\nDash is the main hub for everything that has to do with logging (like finding why a request is slow or whether an email has been delivered), reporting (everything from number of support cases handled to split of devices used to access Basecamp), application health (response times, job queue exceptions etc).\\\\n\\\\n[dash.37signals.com](https://dash.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Queenbee\\\\n\\\\nQueenbee is our invoice, accounting, and identity system. Here you can look up any customer account, see whether they are comped, refund an invoice, or even login as a customer.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s an immense amount of power and we take its use very seriously. We only ever login as a customer after having been given explicit permission to do so, never preemptively. Our customers expect that their information is confidential, even from us, and we intend to honor that expectation at all times.\\\\n\\\\n[billing.37signals.com](https://billing.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### The 37 command\\\\n\\\\nThis is perhaps less of a system and more of an interface to all our other systems. The 37 command gives easy access to the production consoles for all the applications, which is often needed when diagnosing or fixing custom issues. It also allows you to directly grep and tail log files for live debugging, amongst other things.\\\\n\\\\n[github.com/basecamp/37](https://github.com/basecamp/37)\\\\n\\\\n### Sentry\\\\n\\\\nWe track programming exceptions on Sentry. When a customer hits a “Oops, something went wrong!” screen, that means there’ll be an entry in Sentry explaining to programmers why they saw that screen. Keeping the exceptions under control and monitored is primarily the responsibility of SIP and Jim via on-call.\\\\n\\\\n[getsentry.com](https://getsentry.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Kandji\\\\n\\\\n[Kandji](https://kandji.com) is how we make sure all work laptops are securely configured and running the latest software updates. It helps us reduce our exposure to security incidents. You can read more about this in [Managing work devices](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/managing-work-devices.md).\\\\n\\\\n### Shipshape\\\\n\\\\nShipshape is the OG in-house tool for ensuring your work laptop is safe and secure. We still run it, but it\\'s gradually being superceded by Kandji. When you’re given access to the company’s GitHub account, you can run Shipshape to be sure you’re up to code.

       "     \"{'file': 'how-we-work.md', 'content': '# How We Work\\\\n\\\\n## Cycles\\\\n\\\\nWe work in 6-week or 8-week cycles at 37signals. There are typically six cycles to a year. Two are 8-week cycles, during Summer Hours, and the rest 6-week cycles. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\\\\n\\\\nThis is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain — and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Cooldown\\\\n\\\\nIn between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. It’s sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down”. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\\\\n\\\\n## Communication\\\\n\\\\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\\\\n\\\\nDaily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you’re only subscribed to your team’s answers. You’re of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you’re not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.\\\\n\\\\nThird, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\\\\n\\\\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\\\\n\\\\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\\\\n\\\\nAll these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year.\\\\n\\\\n## Pitches\\\\n\\\\nWhether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\\\\n\\\\nWrite-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\\\\n\\\\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\\\\n\\\\nWhile a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.\\\\n\\\\n## Asynchronously\\\\n\\\\nWe have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.\\\\n\\\\nIn certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.\\\\n\\\\n## In self-sufficient, independent teams\\\\n\\\\nOrganizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means we can’t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.\\\\n\\\\n## With managers of one\\\\n\\\\nWe rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.\\\\n\\\\nThat means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\\\\n\\\\n## Balanced\\\\n\\\\nWe limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.\\\\n\\\\nThere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.3778957313382697}\"],\n",

       "   'output': {'answer': '37signals\\' perspective that marketing is a collective responsibility is shaped by several key influences, as documented in the texts provided. Specifically, the company\\'s approach to marketing being everyone\\'s responsibility can be attributed to their culture of autonomy, their emphasis on individual and team contributions, and their engagement with customers and the broader community.\\n\\n1. **Autonomy and Leadership**: Influenced by *Turn The Ship Around* by David Marquet, 37signals prioritizes giving control rather than taking control and emphasizes creating leaders rather than followers. This ethos encourages employees to act on their own, without waiting for permission. This approach naturally extends to marketing, as employees feel empowered to contribute to the company\\'s image and messaging in their own ways ([What Influenced Us](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404)).\\n\\n2. **Customer Interactions as Marketing Moments**: The document \"37signals Is You\" highlights that every interaction an employee has with a customer, whether through support, social media, or otherwise, represents 37signals and contributes to its market perception. This philosophy underscores the belief that marketing is not a separate function confined to a specific department but is woven into the fabric of every employee\\'s day-to-day activities. It stresses the importance of recognizing that these interactions are crucial marketing opportunities that shape how the company is perceived ([37signals Is You](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/37signals-is-you.md)).\\n\\n3. **Collaboration and Sharing**: The company\\'s practice of out-teaching, out-sharing, and out-collaborating, as mentioned in \"37signals Is You\", is part of its marketing strategy. By contributing to open-source projects and sharing knowledge and tools, 37signals enhances its visibility and reputation in the industry. This collaborative spirit is not limited to specific individuals but is a collective effort that involves everyone in the company.\\n\\n4. **The Emphasis on Word of Mouth**: The document also mentions that most of 37signals\\' customers come from word of mouth, suggesting that the reputation of the company is significantly influenced by the experiences customers have with any team member. This further supports their perspective that every employee plays a role in marketing by contributing to a positive image of the company ([37signals Is You](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/37signals-is-you.md)).\\n\\nIn summary, the influences shaping the perspective that marketing is a collective responsibility at 37signals include a strong belief in autonomy and leadership, the recognition that every customer interaction is a moment that reflects the company, a culture of collaboration and sharing, and an understanding of the importance of word of mouth. These principles are embedded in the company\\'s culture and have been influenced by various readings and philosophies that prioritize individual empowerment, customer engagement, and collective contribution over traditional, siloed approaches to marketing.',\n",

Since then there’s been a number of key influencers that have marked the company culture.\\\\n\\\\n## Books\\\\n\\\\n* [Turn The Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404): “Leadership should mean giving control rather than taking control and creating leaders rather than forging followers”, David Marquet. 37signals employs great people and they deserve the freedom and autonomy to act on their own. Don’t wait for permission, just state what you’re going to do, and then do it.\\\\n* [Finding Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114/): True happiness is found in optimal moments of engagement when we stretch just beyond our abilities and lose track of time and space in the process. Protecting the flow by limiting interruptions has been a driving principle of 37signals.\\\\n* [Punished by Rewards](https://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816/): We don’t strive for trophies, swoon for trinkets, gameify our apps with badges, or push any other form of extrinsic motivation for neither ourselves nor our customers. Working at 37signals should be about the intrinsic motivation of doing a good job, not because you’re trying to impress someone else.\\\\n* [The Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Philosophers-Guide-Life/dp/1545461112/): “Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things”. Core lessons on keeping calm and carrying on that have inspired and guided us.\\\\n* [Maverick](https://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0446670553/): Ricardo Semler helped us find the confidence to promote and push for weird and different ways of working by showing just how weird and different you can work at even a place as stodgy as a 8,000-person industrial company in Brazil.\\\\n\\\\n## People\\\\n\\\\n* [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck)\\\\n* [Martin Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer))\\\\n* [Kathy Sierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra)\\\\n* [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander)\\\\n* [Bob Moesta](https://blog.intercom.com/podcast-bob-moesta-on-jobs-to-be-done/)\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.6351285692542666}\",\n",
       "     \"{'file': '37signals-is-you.md', 'content': '# 37signals Is You\\\\n\\\\nEveryone working at 37signals represents 37signals. When a customer gets a response from Merissa on support, Merissa is 37signals. When a customer reads a tweet by Eron that our systems are down, Eron is 37signals. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.\\\\n\\\\nThe vast majority of our customers come from word of mouth and much of that word comes from people in our audience. This is an audience we’ve been educating and entertaining for 20 years and counting, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not! Tell us and our audience what you have to say!\\\\n\\\\nThis goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. 37signals not only tries to out-teach the competition, but also out-share and out-collaborate. We’re prolific open source contributors through Ruby on Rails, Trix, Turbolinks, Stimulus, and many other projects. Extracting the common infrastructure that others could use as well is satisfying, important work, and we should continue to do that.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s also worth mentioning that joining 37signals can be all-consuming. We’ve seen it happen. You dig 37signals, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here’s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We’re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it’s a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We’ll all be better for it.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.6302477987730617}\",\n",
       "     \"{'file': 'how-we-work.md', 'content': '# How We Work\\\\n\\\\n## Cycles\\\\n\\\\nWe work in 6-week or 8-week cycles at 37signals. There are typically six cycles to a year. Two are 8-week cycles, during Summer Hours, and the rest 6-week cycles. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\\\\n\\\\nThis is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain — and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Cooldown\\\\n\\\\nIn between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. It’s sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down”. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\\\\n\\\\n## Communication\\\\n\\\\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\\\\n\\\\nDaily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you’re only subscribed to your team’s answers. You’re of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you’re not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.\\\\n\\\\nThird, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\\\\n\\\\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\\\\n\\\\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\\\\n\\\\nAll these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year.\\\\n\\\\n## Pitches\\\\n\\\\nWhether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\\\\n\\\\nWrite-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\\\\n\\\\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\\\\n\\\\nWhile a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.\\\\n\\\\n## Asynchronously\\\\n\\\\nWe have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.\\\\n\\\\nIn certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.\\\\n\\\\n## In self-sufficient, independent teams\\\\n\\\\nOrganizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means we can’t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.\\\\n\\\\n## With managers of one\\\\n\\\\nWe rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.\\\\n\\\\nThat means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\\\\n\\\\n## Balanced\\\\n\\\\nWe limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.\\\\n\\\\nThere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.49231908215450215}\",\n",

In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 10, 20, 30 employees to now a company of over 80, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it. It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps 37signals in particular, given how different some of our practices are. There’s as much to unlearn as there is to learn. Prior to this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral. For a company that prides itself on clarity and writing, that just wasn’t right.\\\\n\\\\nSo, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about 37signals the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when they call for “judo” (redefining a hard problem into an easy one) or whether it’s okay to take your vacation when you’ve only been with us for a month (yes).\\\\n\\\\nThis handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we’re not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with 37signals for a while to spot the broken ways.

       "     \"{'file': 'making-a-career.md', 'content': '# Making A Career\\\\n\\\\n## Your First 90 Days\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations! You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5396789733760023}\"],\n",

Here\\'s why it\\'s critical:\\n\\n1. **Promotes Rational Decision-making:** By advocating for a levelheaded approach, the company encourages making decisions based on careful thought, reasoned analysis, and a balanced perspective rather than on impulsive reactions or emotions. This minimizes the risk of making hasty decisions that could have adverse consequences.\\n\\n2. **Fosters a Constructive Environment:** Levelheadedness helps in creating a work environment where employees feel respected and valued. When everyone responds to disagreements or critiques calmly and thoughtfully, it nurtures a culture of constructive feedback, enabling individuals to grow and improve.\\n\\n3. **Improves Conflict Resolution:** Calm and considered responses to disagreements or attacks facilitate better conflict resolution. Addressing the idea or situation directly, rather than attacking the personality or succumbing to pressure, can lead to more effective problem-solving and maintain harmonious relationships within the team.\\n\\n4. **Enhances Collaboration:** A levelheaded approach fosters an atmosphere of trust and openness. When employees know that their colleagues will respond thoughtfully and without spite, it encourages more open sharing of ideas and collaborative teamwork.\\n\\n5. **Builds External Reputation:** Externally, responding calmly and clearly to clients, competitors, or any outside criticism portrays the company as professional and composed. This can enhance the company’s reputation and foster stronger relationships with clients and partners.\\n\\nIn summary, levelheadedness is pivotal for maintaining a healthy work environment, making well-considered decisions, effectively resolving conflicts, fostering collaboration, and upholding the company\\'s external reputation. It is a value that underpins the company’s ability to navigate challenges thoughtfully and achieve its objectives while maintaining respect and dignity for all involved.',\n",
       "    'contexts': [\"{'file': 'what-we-stand-for.md', 'content': '# What We Stand For\\\\n\\\\n## Values\\\\n\\\\nBefore anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything’s harder when we all believe different things about what’s important to *us*, our company.\\\\n\\\\nKey values:\\\\n\\\\n* **Be Straightforward.** Whenever we speak — internally or externally — we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn’t mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but it’s got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Don’t use eight words when five will do.\\\\n\\\\n* **Be fair and do the right thing.** What’s fair? What’s the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone’s judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is “what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help?” An example might be providing a refund even if it’s a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says “Sure we can do that for you” when a customer expected you to say “sorry, we can’t.” If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it.\\\\n\\\\n* **Levelheadedness**. We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don’t act out of spite, we don’t rush to judgment, we don’t jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly — directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure.\\\\n\\\\n* **Generosity.** Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure — we give what we’re expected to, and then some.\\\\n\\\\n* **Independence.** This one’s a bit of a contradiction. After speaking about shared values, here’s one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking. Since day one, we’ve always done things our way. We don’t look to the industry or our competitors for the way forward. We see things with our own eyes, make our own calls, and offer thoughts, perspectives, ideas, and products that *we* think are right, not that *they* think are right.\\\\n\\\\n## Helping small businesses deal with growth\\\\n\\\\nGrowth happens.\\\\n\\\\nGrowth makes a lot of things more difficult — people don’t know each other as well, information is harder to find, stuff gets lost, communication becomes muddled, it becomes harder to stay on top of everything that’s going on, etc. What worked for 3 or 5 people, doesn’t work as well at 6 or 8. And certainly not 10, 15, 25 or more.\\\\n\\\\nAt some point, growing small businesses need a system, something to stay organized, something to grow with so they don’t lose control of themselves along the way. Company-wide communication, team-based communication, and project work needs a home.\\\\n\\\\nMost companies cobble together a latticework of separate tools as they grow, but the weight of disorganization and lack of order collapses and eventually catches up to them. Email doesn’t cut it anymore. More meetings aren’t going to solve the problem. And increasingly, incessant chatting creates exponentially more communication without the necessary structure and context to make it useful.\\\\n\\\\nThis is where Basecamp comes in.\\\\n\\\\nBasecamp helps growing companies organize their projects, internal communications, and client work *in one place* so they have a central source of truth. People know what to do, they know where things are, it’s clear where things stand, and everyone is accountable.\\\\n\\\\nThis is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards a more perfect system, but we help groups of people get their shit together — and keep it together — so they can do their best work with their team, in their company, for their own customers.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.3915528751404398}\",\n",

       "     \"{'file': 'README.md', 'content': '[Read on basecamp.com](https://basecamp.com/handbook)\\\\n\\\\n# 37signals Employee Handbook\\\\n\\\\nFor over 10 years, we didn’t have a handbook. In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 10, 20, 30 employees to now a company of over 80, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it. It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps 37signals in particular, given how different some of our practices are. There’s as much to unlearn as there is to learn. Prior to this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral. For a company that prides itself on clarity and writing, that just wasn’t right.\\\\n\\\\nSo, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about 37signals the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when they call for “judo” (redefining a hard problem into an easy one) or whether it’s okay to take your vacation when you’ve only been with us for a month (yes).\\\\n\\\\nThis handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we’re not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with 37signals for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.\\\\n\\\\n## Sections\\\\n\\\\n* [37signals Is You](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/37signals-is-you.md)\\\\n* [What We Stand For](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/what-we-stand-for.md)\\\\n* [What Influenced Us](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/what-influenced-us.md)\\\\n* [Vocabulary](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/vocabulary.md)\\\\n* [Product Histories](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/product-histories.md)\\\\n* [Where We Work](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/where-we-work.md)\\\\n* [Benefits & Perks](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md)\\\\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/getting-started.md)\\\\n* [How We Work](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md)\\\\n* [Our Rituals](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/our-rituals.md)\\\\n* [Making a Career](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/making-a-career.md)\\\\n* [Our Internal Systems](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/our-internal-systems.md)\\\\n* [A Note About Moonlighting](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/moonlighting.md)\\\\n* [International Travel Guide](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/international-travel-guide.md)\\\\n* [FAQ](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/faq.md)\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.33155832160971715}\",\n",
       "     \"{'file': 'how-we-work.md', 'content': '# How We Work\\\\n\\\\n## Cycles\\\\n\\\\nWe work in 6-week or 8-week cycles at 37signals. There are typically six cycles to a year. Two are 8-week cycles, during Summer Hours, and the rest 6-week cycles. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\\\\n\\\\nThis is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain — and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Cooldown\\\\n\\\\nIn between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. It’s sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down”. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\\\\n\\\\n## Communication\\\\n\\\\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\\\\n\\\\nDaily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you’re only subscribed to your team’s answers. You’re of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you’re not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.\\\\n\\\\nThird, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\\\\n\\\\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\\\\n\\\\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\\\\n\\\\nAll these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year.\\\\n\\\\n## Pitches\\\\n\\\\nWhether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\\\\n\\\\nWrite-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\\\\n\\\\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\\\\n\\\\nWhile a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.\\\\n\\\\n## Asynchronously\\\\n\\\\nWe have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.\\\\n\\\\nIn certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.\\\\n\\\\n## In self-sufficient, independent teams\\\\n\\\\nOrganizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means we can’t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.\\\\n\\\\n## With managers of one\\\\n\\\\nWe rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.\\\\n\\\\nThat means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\\\\n\\\\n## Balanced\\\\n\\\\nWe limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.\\\\n\\\\nThere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.33140254439253025}\"],\n",

The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here’s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We’re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it’s a job.

       "     \"{'file': 'how-we-work.md', 'content': '# How We Work\\\\n\\\\n## Cycles\\\\n\\\\nWe work in 6-week or 8-week cycles at 37signals. There are typically six cycles to a year. Two are 8-week cycles, during Summer Hours, and the rest 6-week cycles. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\\\\n\\\\nThis is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain — and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Cooldown\\\\n\\\\nIn between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. It’s sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down”. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\\\\n\\\\n## Communication\\\\n\\\\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\\\\n\\\\nDaily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you’re only subscribed to your team’s answers. You’re of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you’re not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.\\\\n\\\\nThird, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\\\\n\\\\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\\\\n\\\\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\\\\n\\\\nAll these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year.\\\\n\\\\n## Pitches\\\\n\\\\nWhether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\\\\n\\\\nWrite-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\\\\n\\\\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\\\\n\\\\nWhile a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.\\\\n\\\\n## Asynchronously\\\\n\\\\nWe have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.\\\\n\\\\nIn certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.\\\\n\\\\n## In self-sufficient, independent teams\\\\n\\\\nOrganizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means we can’t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.\\\\n\\\\n## With managers of one\\\\n\\\\nWe rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.\\\\n\\\\nThat means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\\\\n\\\\n## Balanced\\\\n\\\\nWe limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.\\\\n\\\\nThere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5050120084667302}\",\n",

In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 10, 20, 30 employees to now a company of over 80, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it. It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps 37signals in particular, given how different some of our practices are. There’s as much to unlearn as there is to learn. Prior to this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral. For a company that prides itself on clarity and writing, that just wasn’t right.\\\\n\\\\nSo, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about 37signals the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when they call for “judo” (redefining a hard problem into an easy one) or whether it’s okay to take your vacation when you’ve only been with us for a month (yes).\\\\n\\\\nThis handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we’re not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with 37signals for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.\\\\n\\\\n## Sections\\\\n\\\\n* [37signals Is You](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/37signals-is-you.md)\\\\n* [What We Stand For](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/what-we-stand-for.md)\\\\n* [What Influenced Us](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/what-influenced-us.md)\\\\n* [Vocabulary](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/vocabulary.md)\\\\n* [Product Histories](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/product-histories.md)\\\\n* [Where We Work](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/where-we-work.md)\\\\n* [Benefits & Perks](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md)\\\\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/getting-started.md)\\\\n* [How We Work](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md)\\\\n* [Our Rituals](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/our-rituals.md)\\\\n* [Making a Career](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/making-a-career.md)\\\\n* [Our Internal Systems](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/our-internal-systems.md)\\\\n* [A Note About Moonlighting](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/moonlighting.md)\\\\n* [International Travel Guide](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/international-travel-guide.md)\\\\n* [FAQ](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/faq.md)\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.4963348260403114}\"],\n",

       "   'output': {'answer': 'The concept of a presentable scope of work significantly contributes to effective project management at 37signals in several ways, all geared towards ensuring that projects are manageable, achievable, and align with the company\\'s operational rhythms. Here’s a detailed explanation based on related insights from the provided documents:\\n\\n1. **Cycles [How We Work]:** 37signals organizes work in fixed 6-week or 8-week cycles. This structure inherently demands a disciplined approach to defining what can realistically be achieved within these time frames. By encouraging teams to think upfront about a manageable and presentable scope of work, it ensures that projects are designed to fit within a cycle, promoting a focused and efficient allocation of resources.\\n\\n2. **Scope Limits and Urgency [How We Work]:** The fixed cycle lengths serve multiple purposes, including acting as a \"scope hammer\" to prevent project bloat and instilling a sense of urgency. This makes the concept of a presentable scope of work crucial as it necessitates identifying the essential aspects of a project that can be realistically completed within the cycle. This focus on essentialism helps prevent overreach and keeps the team aligned on what\\'s achievable, fostering greater efficiency and effectiveness in project execution.\\n\\n3. **Scope Hammering [Vocabulary]:** When initial aspirations for a feature exceed the cycle budget, the team employs \"scope hammering\" to adjust the project scope to make it doable within the allocated time. This involves making tough decisions about what features or aspects to prioritize and what to postpone or remove. Having a presentable scope of work that has been trimmed to fit the cycle helps ensure that projects remain on track without overextending resources or resorting to unsustainable work practices.\\n\\n4. **Judo [Vocabulary]:** The concept of judo in problem-solving at 37signals also intersects with the idea of a presentable scope of work. When faced with challenges that seem insurmountable within the cycle timeframe, the team seeks to \"judo\" the problem. This often involves reimagining the project scope in a more manageable way without sacrificing the core value or goal. This flexibility in approach ensures that even complex projects can be tackled effectively by breaking them down into achievable scopes of work.\\n\\n5. **Regular Intervals for Decision Making [How We Work]:** The cadence of cycles provides regular opportunities to evaluate what the company is working on. This rhythmic approach to project planning and execution demands a continuous reassessment of the scope of work to ensure it remains relevant, achievable, and aligned with the company’s strategic goals. It allows projects to be adaptable and responsive to change, a key aspect of effective project management.\\n\\nIn summary, the concept of a presentable scope of work is integral to effective project management at 37signals. It underpins the company’s distinct approach to work cycles, encouraging disciplined, agile, and strategic project planning and execution. This focus on manageability, along with techniques for refining scope, ensures that projects are completed efficiently, within set timelines, and without compromising the well-being of the team or the quality of the output.',\n",
       "    'contexts': [\"{'file': 'vocabulary.md', 'content': '# Vocabulary\\\\n\\\\n37signals has over time developed a vocabulary specific to our work and company.\\\\n\\\\n## Chowder\\\\n\\\\nWhen establishing the tasks under a project, there are must-haves and maybes. Chowder is a shorthand we use to refer to the maybes.\\\\n\\\\n## Judo\\\\n\\\\nMost problems can be solved in a thousand different ways. One way might take 100 hours, another might take 10. Judo is the art of problem restatement. Turning that massive, scary 3-month looking problem into one that can be done in 3 weeks instead. It’s often used when we get frustrated trying to solve something hard and we aren’t making sufficient progress: “Let’s figure out a way to judo this!”.\\\\n\\\\n## PDI\\\\n\\\\n“Please do investigate”.

It helps everyone on the project understand that we’re going to look into it but it may or may not be feasible, practical, or possible.\\\\n\\\\n## Scope Hammering\\\\n\\\\nIt’s a rare case when our initial aspirations for a feature don’t meet the boundaries of our cycle budgets. When that happens, our go-to tool for shipping is scope hammering. This basically just means shrinking the scope, removing features or configuration or fidelity, until the work is doable within the time left. It’s the opposite tactic to working longer days or weekends or to postpone the project into another cycle. Almost every project can be scope hammered, especially if you invite someone in to assist with the analysis who isn’t afraid to kill other people’s darlings. You’ll get better at doing that yourself after a few rounds too.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5338411635736704}\",\n",

So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.\\\\n\\\\n## Asynchronously\\\\n\\\\nWe have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.\\\\n\\\\nIn certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.\\\\n\\\\n## In self-sufficient, independent teams\\\\n\\\\nOrganizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means we can’t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.\\\\n\\\\n## With managers of one\\\\n\\\\nWe rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.\\\\n\\\\nThat means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\\\\n\\\\n## Balanced\\\\n\\\\nWe limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.\\\\n\\\\nThere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5282838195381891}\",\n",

We’ve been around since 1999. Since then there’s been a number of key influencers that have marked the company culture.\\\\n\\\\n## Books\\\\n\\\\n* [Turn The Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404): “Leadership should mean giving control rather than taking control and creating leaders rather than forging followers”, David Marquet. 37signals employs great people and they deserve the freedom and autonomy to act on their own. Don’t wait for permission, just state what you’re going to do, and then do it.\\\\n* [Finding Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114/): True happiness is found in optimal moments of engagement when we stretch just beyond our abilities and lose track of time and space in the process. Protecting the flow by limiting interruptions has been a driving principle of 37signals.\\\\n* [Punished by Rewards](https://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816/): We don’t strive for trophies, swoon for trinkets, gameify our apps with badges, or push any other form of extrinsic motivation for neither ourselves nor our customers. Working at 37signals should be about the intrinsic motivation of doing a good job, not because you’re trying to impress someone else.\\\\n* [The Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Philosophers-Guide-Life/dp/1545461112/): “Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things”.

When a customer gets a response from Merissa on support, Merissa is 37signals. When a customer reads a tweet by Eron that our systems are down, Eron is 37signals. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.\\\\n\\\\nThe vast majority of our customers come from word of mouth and much of that word comes from people in our audience. This is an audience we’ve been educating and entertaining for 20 years and counting, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not! Tell us and our audience what you have to say!\\\\n\\\\nThis goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. 37signals not only tries to out-teach the competition, but also out-share and out-collaborate. We’re prolific open source contributors through Ruby on Rails, Trix, Turbolinks, Stimulus, and many other projects. Extracting the common infrastructure that others could use as well is satisfying, important work, and we should continue to do that.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s also worth mentioning that joining 37signals can be all-consuming. We’ve seen it happen. You dig 37signals, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here’s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We’re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it’s a job.

You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.47421390080368475}\"],\n",

Here's a breakdown of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Initial Reviews for New Employees**: If you are new to 37signals, you will have formal performance reviews at three key intervals:\\n   - **3-month mark**: This is likely the first formal performance review you'll have after joining the company. It offers an early opportunity to gauge how well you're integrating into your role and the company culture.\\n   - **6-month mark**: This second review provides a platform to assess your progress, improvements, and areas that might still need development since your first review.\\n   - **1-year mark**: This review is a significant milestone, allowing both you and your manager to reflect on a full year's worth of work, achievements, and areas for future growth.\\n\\n2. **Annual Reviews for Established Employees**: After your first year, formal performance reviews shift to an annual schedule. These reviews typically occur around your work anniversary. This regular cadence allows both you and your management to assess your progress, set new goals, and discuss potential areas for development or enhancement.\\n\\n3. **Content of Reviews**: During these formal performance reviews, your manager will share with you the performance expectations for your role. These expectations should have been communicated to you when you started, but they can evolve. It's important to stay informed of any changes. Your manager is also expected to provide documentation of the outcomes of these reviews, including any action items, goals, or deadlines that have been agreed upon.\\n\\n4. **Feedback and Growth**: The performance review process at 37signals is designed to be a two-way conversation. It’s an opportunity for you to receive candid feedback on your work and also to share your feedback with your manager. This process helps ensure that you are aligned with the company’s goals and are provided with the support you need to grow and succeed in your role.\\n\\nPerformance reviews at 37signals are structured to support employee development and ensure that employees are meeting the expected performance standards. They are an integral part of maintaining open communication lines between managers and their team members, facilitating ongoing feedback, and aligning individual goals with the broader objectives of the company.\",\n",

After a year, you\\'ll be offered an additional 2 weeks of severance pay for every 6 months of employment over 1 year, with a maximum of 6 months of severance pay. The package also includes health insurance for you and your dependents if you’ve been on our policies for the same time periods, compensation for unused vacation time, and compensation for unused sabbatical time if applicable (1 year look back). Compensation for all pay categories is calculated using your hourly rate. In return, you’ll be asked for a general release of liabilities and other standard employment termination terms. When you begin looking for work, your manager may provide references, if desired.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s the most important detail missing from the above process?\\\\n\\\\n_Support._\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will offer extra support during the PIP process. We know lots of external factors can come into play at work. If you’re having personal or professional issues that are harming your performance, please tell your manager so they can work with you.\\\\n\\\\nLots of employees who still work at 37signals have been on PIPs. We’re not in the game of high turnover. We want to see you through the process and see you come out energized on the other side. We care about everyone who works here and if you’re having performance issues, our first reaction is to help you. We only ask that you work with us to devise a realistic improvement plan that elevates you _and_ works for 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n## Exceptions\\\\n\\\\nThe process outlined above is for employees who are dealing with manageable performance or disciplinary issues. If an employee is negligent in their duties or commits fraud or insubordination to the point that a performance plan won’t serve 37signals or the employee, we retain the right to immediately terminate at-will as stated in our employment contracts. 37signals also retains the right to bypass steps outlined above, including offering a severance package, if the severity of performance problems warrants that. In either of these cases, the reasoning will be spelled out in detail to the employee prior to termination.\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.569723441804731}',\n",

We’ve been around since 1999. Since then there’s been a number of key influencers that have marked the company culture.\\\\n\\\\n## Books\\\\n\\\\n* [Turn The Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404): “Leadership should mean giving control rather than taking control and creating leaders rather than forging followers”, David Marquet. 37signals employs great people and they deserve the freedom and autonomy to act on their own. Don’t wait for permission, just state what you’re going to do, and then do it.\\\\n* [Finding Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114/): True happiness is found in optimal moments of engagement when we stretch just beyond our abilities and lose track of time and space in the process. Protecting the flow by limiting interruptions has been a driving principle of 37signals.\\\\n* [Punished by Rewards](https://www.amazon.com/Punished-Rewards-Trouble-Incentive-Praise/dp/0618001816/): We don’t strive for trophies, swoon for trinkets, gameify our apps with badges, or push any other form of extrinsic motivation for neither ourselves nor our customers. Working at 37signals should be about the intrinsic motivation of doing a good job, not because you’re trying to impress someone else.\\\\n* [The Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Philosophers-Guide-Life/dp/1545461112/): “Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things”. Core lessons on keeping calm and carrying on that have inspired and guided us.\\\\n* [Maverick](https://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0446670553/): Ricardo Semler helped us find the confidence to promote and push for weird and different ways of working by showing just how weird and different you can work at even a place as stodgy as a 8,000-person industrial company in Brazil.\\\\n\\\\n## People\\\\n\\\\n* [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck)\\\\n* [Martin Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer))\\\\n* [Kathy Sierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra)\\\\n* [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander)\\\\n* [Bob Moesta](https://blog.intercom.com/podcast-bob-moesta-on-jobs-to-be-done/)\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.4565558118591415}\",\n",

What follows is a set of guidelines on how we get there.\\\\n\\\\nBehavior that contributes to a healthy and friendly work environment:\\\\n\\\\n- Using courteous language.\\\\n- Being respectful and empathetic, especially when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences.\\\\n- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and direct feedback, as well as offering it in that spirit.\\\\n- Assuming good intentions. Approaching work relationships with a default of trust and positivity.\\\\n\\\\nUnacceptable behavior:\\\\n\\\\n- The use of any sexualized language or imagery.\\\\n- The use of any violent language or imagery.\\\\n- Making unwelcome sexual advances or giving unwanted sexual attention.\\\\n- Any form of discrimination and harassment. Particularly on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.\\\\n\\\\nThese expectations apply to all current employees. Unacceptable employee conduct will not be tolerated virtually (e.g. in Basecamp, GitHub) or at in-person events.\\\\n\\\\n## Reporting\\\\n\\\\nIf you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to leadership via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.\\\\n\\\\nIf an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or even termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.\\\\n\\\\nIn extreme circumstances, you can [report an incident anonymously](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4177996672). Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.\\\\n\\\\nAn important note: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for the kind of unacceptable behavior outlined above and other serious transgressions — illegal or egregiously unethical behavior.\\\\n\\\\n## Some Definitions & Resources\\\\n\\\\n- [Discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/discrimination-type)\\\\n- [Harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment)\\\\n- [Sexual Harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment)\\\\n- [Retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals Code of Conduct is not meant to be a replacement for your EEO rights.

       "     \"{'file': 'making-a-career.md', 'content': '# Making A Career\\\\n\\\\n## Your First 90 Days\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations! You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5431059214568673}\"],\n",

We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not usually initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the steps your manager will take at 37signals when they identify a problem with your performance that must be addressed with a performance improvement plan (PIP).\\\\n\\\\n## Identify and Document\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will identify a productivity or disciplinary problem as soon as possible after it occurs if it’s a specific incident, or as soon as they can when they sense a general problem with your ongoing performance. Your formal reviews may be helpful in identifying a problem, but managers shouldn’t wait for those reviews to raise a problem with you.\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will have a conversation with you about:\\\\n\\\\n1. the specific problem\\\\n2. the steps required for you to correct\\\\n3. the timeline for correction\\\\n\\\\n## Revisit Throughout Timeline & On Deadline\\\\n\\\\nYour timeline for taking steps to correct your performance is at the discretion of your manager. During that timeframe, you and your manager will check in periodically about whether or not they’re seeing the improvement they’ve asked to see.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you come to the end of your PIP timeline, you and your manager will have a formal check-in. If your performance is back where it should be, that’s the end of this process.\\\\n\\\\nIf your performance is _not_ where it should be, your manager will outline next steps. If they feel you’re putting forth good effort and could use more time to show improvement, they may extend the timeline of the PIP. If your manager feels your performance has not improved at all and you haven’t met the requirements outlined in your PIP, they may decide to terminate your employment with 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are terminated, you’ll be offered a severance package. If you\\'ve been with the company for less than 1 year, you\\'ll be offered 4 weeks severance pay. After a year, you\\'ll be offered an additional 2 weeks of severance pay for every 6 months of employment over 1 year, with a maximum of 6 months of severance pay. The package also includes health insurance for you and your dependents if you’ve been on our policies for the same time periods, compensation for unused vacation time, and compensation for unused sabbatical time if applicable (1 year look back). Compensation for all pay categories is calculated using your hourly rate. In return, you’ll be asked for a general release of liabilities and other standard employment termination terms. When you begin looking for work, your manager may provide references, if desired.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s the most important detail missing from the above process?\\\\n\\\\n_Support._\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will offer extra support during the PIP process. We know lots of external factors can come into play at work. If you’re having personal or professional issues that are harming your performance, please tell your manager so they can work with you.\\\\n\\\\nLots of employees who still work at 37signals have been on PIPs. We’re not in the game of high turnover. We want to see you through the process and see you come out energized on the other side. We care about everyone who works here and if you’re having performance issues, our first reaction is to help you. We only ask that you work with us to devise a realistic improvement plan that elevates you _and_ works for 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n## Exceptions\\\\n\\\\nThe process outlined above is for employees who are dealing with manageable performance or disciplinary issues. If an employee is negligent in their duties or commits fraud or insubordination to the point that a performance plan won’t serve 37signals or the employee, we retain the right to immediately terminate at-will as stated in our employment contracts. 37signals also retains the right to bypass steps outlined above, including offering a severance package, if the severity of performance problems warrants that.

It’s not a black and white topic. There are one-time gigs, other pursuits, or opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting. We want to support that. But we want to make sure professional endeavors outside of 37signals don’t create conflicts of interest or affect your time, dedication, or performance at 37signals. So it’s a delicate balance.\\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, here are some examples of what we’d consider OK and what we would consider a conflict of interest and not OK:\\\\n\\\\n## OK\\\\n\\\\n1. An occasional side gig, free or paid, for someone you know. For example, if you want to work on a friend’s website, or a design or writing project for something you’re involved with, that’s fine.\\\\n\\\\n2. An occasional speaking gig, free or paid. Someone’s going to pay you to give a talk somewhere? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t involve multiple days off for travel (unless you use your own personal vacation time against this travel time).\\\\n\\\\n3. A side business that’s different from your day job, as long as the commitment is only a few hours a week. If you come to work exhausted because you’re trying to start a full-time business on the side, it’s going to impact your performance here.\\\\n\\\\n4. Serve as an advisor for another company, or be on a board, as long as there’s no conflict of interest. The time commitment must be under a few hours a month. And if there’s a scheduling conflict, 37signals gets priority.\\\\n\\\\n5. Do volunteer or occasional pro-bono work for a cause you’re actively involved with. A little work here and there is fine, but, for example, becoming an organization’s full-time web designer and being on the hook to work during your standard work day, etc, would not be OK.\\\\n\\\\n## Not OK\\\\n\\\\n1. You can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry. If you’re unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation you’d like to talk about, ping Jason or David.\\\\n\\\\n2. Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow teammates.\\\\n\\\\n3. Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to 37signals, etc).\\\\n\\\\n4. Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.\\\\n\\\\n5. Take on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That would ultimately be a problem.\\\\n\\\\n## In general\\\\n\\\\nHere are a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:\\\\n\\\\n* Is it competitive?\\\\n* Does it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?\\\\n* Does it require you to be away during times when you’re needed at work?\\\\n* Is it another paid gig that employs the same skills 37signals is paying you for?\\\\n\\\\nIn general, we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance here at work.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s hard to come up with one-size fits all rules. If you’re in doubt, please reach out to your manager.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.2727006719313841}\",\n",

What follows is a set of guidelines on how we get there.\\\\n\\\\nBehavior that contributes to a healthy and friendly work environment:\\\\n\\\\n- Using courteous language.\\\\n- Being respectful and empathetic, especially when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences.\\\\n- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and direct feedback, as well as offering it in that spirit.\\\\n- Assuming good intentions. Approaching work relationships with a default of trust and positivity.\\\\n\\\\nUnacceptable behavior:\\\\n\\\\n- The use of any sexualized language or imagery.\\\\n- The use of any violent language or imagery.\\\\n- Making unwelcome sexual advances or giving unwanted sexual attention.\\\\n- Any form of discrimination and harassment. Particularly on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.\\\\n\\\\nThese expectations apply to all current employees. Unacceptable employee conduct will not be tolerated virtually (e.g. in Basecamp, GitHub) or at in-person events.\\\\n\\\\n## Reporting\\\\n\\\\nIf you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to leadership via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.\\\\n\\\\nIf an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or even termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.\\\\n\\\\nIn extreme circumstances, you can [report an incident anonymously](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4177996672). Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.\\\\n\\\\nAn important note: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly.

       "    'contexts': [\"{'file': 'international-travel-guide.md', 'content': '# International Travel Guide\\\\n\\\\nIf you travel out of your country of residence with your work laptop or other devices, you may face questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border security. We have answers!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you travel for 37signals business, here’s what you need:\\\\n\\\\n1. Your passport! Apply for one now if you don’t have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six months.\\\\n2. A travel visa, waiver, or an electronic travel authorization. 37signals will cover the cost of any documentation you need to travel on 37signals business.\\\\n3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.\\\\n4. Your lodging address and contact info.\\\\n5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone. Clearing work data from your devices is *required* before crossing any border.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nYou need a visa or a waiver to authorize travel to the US. If your country participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), then you can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) within 3 days of travel. The ESTA is valid for 2 years. [Apply for an ESTA here](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/).\\\\n\\\\nCanadian passport holders don’t need a visa to enter the US for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are all that’s required.\\\\n\\\\n### B-1 Business Visitor Visa\\\\n\\\\nIf your country does not participate in the Visa Waiver Program or you are not eligible for an ESTA, you’ll need to apply for a B-1 business visitor visa… the long way.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll work with you through this process. Start early, as soon as we have dates for a meet-up or conference. Visa appointments and processing can take weeks to months. Ping Andrea as soon as you know that you’ll need a visa.\\\\n\\\\n### Trusted Traveler Programs\\\\n\\\\nCitizens of some countries are eligible for [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/frequently-asked-questions) and Canadians are eligible for [NEXUS](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus/nexus-eligibility). These programs are completely optional but may make life a little easier, at the cost of onerous biometric scans like fingerprinting (for Global Entry and NEXUS) and iris scanning (for NEXUS). Note: An ESTA is still required for travel; these programs just speed up entry.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to countries other than the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nThe visa requirements for your nationality will vary depending on the country you plan to visit, as individual visa policies and requirements vary for different foreign citizens. It may or may not be necessary to obtain a travel document to visit your country of destination.\\\\n\\\\nPlease check the requirements for your nationality with your destination country as far in advance of travel as you can. You can also use a [visa checker](https://www.onlinevisa.com/visa-requirements/). You may be able to travel visa-free, or you may need to obtain a visa, a waiver, or an electronic travel authorization.\\\\n\\\\n### Invitation Letter\\\\n\\\\nTo substantiate the purpose of your travel to any country, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you’re traveling on behalf of 37signals business. Verify in advance if the country you’re visiting *requires* a letter of purpose, and that you won’t need a work visa to accompany a letter.\\\\n\\\\n## Company Security at Border Crossings\\\\n\\\\nWhen you cross a border, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.\\\\n\\\\nWhat’s a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with source code; your tablet where you read work email; your phone where you use the Basecamp app; etc.\\\\n\\\\n### TL;DR: Don’t Travel With Work Data\\\\n\\\\n* If you don’t need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don’t bring it with you!\\\\n* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: Before You Travel\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the US.\\\\n* Update your electronic travel authorization with your travel info when you have it.\\\\n* Ensure you have your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.\\\\n* If you run into general travel issues while on 37signals business, contact Andrea.\\\\n* If you find yourself facing serious consequences like arrest or illegal detention in the United States, you can contact our attorney Jennifer Schaaf. Her contact information is in the teams vault in 1Password. You should also contact your home country’s embassy or consulate; please save that phone number prior to travel.\\\\n* If you’re traveling to a country with privacy laws that concern you, please raise that concern internally with Andrea before you travel so we can discuss putting protections in place, including connecting you with a local, on-call attorney.\\\\n* 1Password\\\\n  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn’t have any work logins. If it does, move them to the team vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the 37signals team which is perfect for those logins.\\\\n  * Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.\\\\n  * Open 1Password on each device you’re traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it’s in Travel Mode.\\\\n* HEY\\\\n  * [Log out of HEY on all sessions.](https://app.hey.com/my/sessions)\\\\n* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.\\\\n  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.\\\\n  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data\\\\n  * [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data. Check Cookies and site data; uncheck all the other items. > Clear data.\\\\n* Source code.\\\\n  * Make an encrypted archive on an external hard drive of your git repos so you can download and restore it after you’re through customs. Here are [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) for doing that if you’re running a Mac OS. Please perform an equally secure file encryption for Windows or Linux OS & check with SIP if you’re unsure how to do that.\\\\n  * Delete all source code from your laptop.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents.\\\\n  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup on your external drive and remove from your laptop. Please refrain from using iCloud for any files/repos.\\\\n* Dropbox\\\\n  * Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.\\\\n* Touch ID (optional)\\\\n  * Unlocking your device can be compelled at US border crossings, but other countries may be less intrusive, so it may make sense to make your device a little harder to unlock.\\\\n  * Disable Touch ID or Face ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: At Customs\\\\n\\\\n* Have ready your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details including the address of where you’ll be staying.\\\\n* Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.\\\\n* Common questions:\\\\n  * Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting in *city*.\\\\n  * Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with 37signals.\\\\n  * Where are you staying? Lodging name, address, phone number.\\\\n* Be straightforward and truthful. You’re legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Arrive\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know when you’ve arrived at your destination and have cleared airport security.\\\\n* Touch ID / Face ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Basecamp app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Disable Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you’ll have full access again.\\\\n* HEY: Log back in on your device(s).\\\\n* Source code: Download and restore the archive of your git repos, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Return\\\\n\\\\n* Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the US.\\\\n\\\\n## Any Questions?\\\\n\\\\nHitting a snag or have any questions?

We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you\\'re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n\\\\nThere are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we\\'ve produced [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.\", \\'similarity\\': 0.42717354573880273}',\n",

They are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n### Dash\\\\n\\\\nDash is the main hub for everything that has to do with logging (like finding why a request is slow or whether an email has been delivered), reporting (everything from number of support cases handled to split of devices used to access Basecamp), application health (response times, job queue exceptions etc).\\\\n\\\\n[dash.37signals.com](https://dash.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Queenbee\\\\n\\\\nQueenbee is our invoice, accounting, and identity system. Here you can look up any customer account, see whether they are comped, refund an invoice, or even login as a customer.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s an immense amount of power and we take its use very seriously. We only ever login as a customer after having been given explicit permission to do so, never preemptively. Our customers expect that their information is confidential, even from us, and we intend to honor that expectation at all times.\\\\n\\\\n[billing.37signals.com](https://billing.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### The 37 command\\\\n\\\\nThis is perhaps less of a system and more of an interface to all our other systems. The 37 command gives easy access to the production consoles for all the applications, which is often needed when diagnosing or fixing custom issues. It also allows you to directly grep and tail log files for live debugging, amongst other things.\\\\n\\\\n[github.com/basecamp/37](https://github.com/basecamp/37)\\\\n\\\\n### Sentry\\\\n\\\\nWe track programming exceptions on Sentry. When a customer hits a “Oops, something went wrong!” screen, that means there’ll be an entry in Sentry explaining to programmers why they saw that screen. Keeping the exceptions under control and monitored is primarily the responsibility of SIP and Jim via on-call.\\\\n\\\\n[getsentry.com](https://getsentry.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Kandji\\\\n\\\\n[Kandji](https://kandji.com) is how we make sure all work laptops are securely configured and running the latest software updates. It helps us reduce our exposure to security incidents. You can read more about this in [Managing work devices](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/managing-work-devices.md).\\\\n\\\\n### Shipshape\\\\n\\\\nShipshape is the OG in-house tool for ensuring your work laptop is safe and secure. We still run it, but it\\'s gradually being superceded by Kandji. When you’re given access to the company’s GitHub account, you can run Shipshape to be sure you’re up to code.

The company pays 75% of the premium and the employee pays the other 25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\nEach pay period, you’ll see a payroll deduction for medical insurance:\\\\n\\\\n* Employee-only medical coverage: $76.93\\\\n* Employee-partner medical coverage: $160.26\\\\n* Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $171.29\\\\n* Employee-family medical coverage: $254.61\\\\n\\\\n### Dental Insurance\\\\n\\\\nDental insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Vision Insurance\\\\n\\\\nVision insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Health Insurance for Staff Outside the US\\\\nIf you’re outside of the US and pay out of pocket for private health insurance, you can request reimbursement for 75% of your insurance payments on your monthly invoice. Your monthly reimbursement is capped at the amount 37signals pays per employee per month on the US employee group plan. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for reimbursement.\\\\n\\\\n### Life Insurance\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers a $400,000 life insurance/AD+D policy to all staff through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and it’s terminated automatically on your final day of employment. Open enrollment is in November every year, and participants are auto-enrolled at that time.\\\\n\\\\n## Retirement Plan\\\\n\\\\nOur retirement plan for US employees is with Vanguard. 37signals matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 6% of your salary. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan with your first paycheck.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re outside the US, 37signals will match what you contribute to a retirement account in your home country, up to 6% of your salary. In these cases, 37signals will pay you directly via your monthly invoice. It’s up to you to invest that payment and maintain administration of the retirement account and its taxes. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for a match.\\\\n\\\\n## Flexible Spending Account (FSA)\\\\n\\\\nThe FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $3,050/year. There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care, and the max for that plan is $5,000/year or $2,500/year if you split this with a partner. This is an entirely optional program. Open enrollment is in December every year, with new coverage beginning January 1. Both FSAs are with Paychex, our payroll provider.\\\\n\\\\n## Paid Time Off\\\\n\\\\n### Vacation Time\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers 18 days of paid time off plus [11 local holidays](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5061131347) every year. We ask that you [track your time off](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/projects/14971171). Your vacation time is prorated based on your start date during your first year at 37signals. Your vacation time rolls over year to year with a maximum bank of 27 days at any time. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals with vacation days in your bank, you’ll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (prorated at the time of your departure).\\\\n\\\\n### Sabbatical\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to annual PTO and holidays, every *three* years employees may take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Give your team a heads-up preferably three months in advance so they can coordinate. If you’re terminated or resign from 37signals with an unused sabbatical, 37signals will pay you the monetary equivalent of those unused days only if your unused sabbatical was earned within the previous 12 months.\\\\n\\\\n### Sick Time\\\\n\\\\nWe don’t offer a bank of sick days nor do we ask you to track your sick days. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to Personal Leave. 37signals does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination, since we have no sick time bank.\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures. If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your manager for accommodations.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you are unable to work for more than 1 week because of illness or injury, let your manager know as soon as you can. You can take four weeks off at 100% pay. If after 4 weeks, you’re still unable to work, your salary will drop to 70% for an additional 8 weeks. Your medical insurance will remain in force throughout your Leave. If after 12 weeks, you still cannot work, talk to your manager, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis. You may be asked to provide medical documentation to support your request for Personal Leave, and Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave per 12-month period.\\\\n\\\\n### Summer Hours\\\\n\\\\nWe work 4-day work weeks from May 1 through August 31 every year. An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible. When a holiday occurs during summer hours, you can take the holiday off *or* your normal summer day off. Any additional days off would count as vacation days.\\\\n\\\\n### Day of Service\\\\n\\\\n37signals also allows a Day of Service. You can take one day off every year to volunteer for a charitable or community organization of your choice. No need to use a vacation day or personal day, just let your team know you’ll be out. 37signals does not pay out for unused Days of Service if you resign or are terminated from 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n### Scheduling Time Off\\\\n\\\\n37signals doesn’t have a formal time off request process. It’s your responsibility to work with your manager and team to ensure coverage and manage your scheduled workload. The sooner you can inform your manager and team of your planned absence, the better, especially longer absences like sabbatical or long vacations. If your team has a defined process for scheduling time off, please follow that first.\\\\n\\\\nThe only time we ask you *not* to schedule discretionary time off is during a CODE. At 37signals, we assign a CODE when urgent work needs to be done. We have three levels of criticality. A CODE RED is an emergency, a CODE YELLOW is less immediate but still critical, and a CODE LAUNCH is called when we’re in the final stages of launching a new product. If we’re in the midst of one of these and you can delay your vacation or sabbatical until after the code has ended, please do.\\\\n\\\\n## Family Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you become the primary caregiver of a child, you can take up to 16 weeks leave at 100% pay. If you become the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% pay. You may choose to take an additional unpaid leave as the primary or secondary caregiver.\\\\n\\\\nSome states require us to provide additional [benefits](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/stateFMLA.md#new-york).\\\\n\\\\n## Bereavement Leave\\\\n\\\\nWhen you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.\\\\n\\\\nYou can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know you’ll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your manager to discuss that special case.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals EAP is through ComPsych, and it provides a *confidential* avenue for you to get assistance with issues regarding health, family, legal, financial, wellness or other personal matters. When you call or email ComPsych, you’ll be connected to a certified representative who can help you one-on-one at that time, or who can refer you to someone in your area for longer-term help. Services range from immediate or crisis mental health care to phone-help on your 401k investments to a referral to a lawyer in your area to help with your estate planning. Because we use the EAP, you also receive discounts on those referrals to professionals.\\\\n\\\\n## Pet Insurance\\\\n\\\\nFor your fur babies! 37signals doesn’t contribute to this plan at all, but everyone gets a 10% discount on this insurance you might otherwise buy. There are no set rates, and you can visit our portal on [Figo’s website](https://figopetinsurance.com) to get your quote and sign up. There’s no open enrollment period to sign up for pet insurance.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Profit Sharing\\\\n\\\\n37signals shares 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2022 profits distributed in March 2023).\\\\n\\\\nYou’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary at 37signals, and you’ll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nWe ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon, not something to be budgeted with, but as a true bonus. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount we’re able to share with employees may swing wildly or not be paid out at all.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Liquidity Pool\\\\n\\\\nThere are no plans to sell 37signals or take the company public! But, in the slight chance of that happening, employees may be eligible to receive a portion of 10% of the value of the company if 37signals is sold or made public. That 10% would be divided into shares, and shares distributed amongst employees based on their tenure at the time of the sale/offering.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees are eligible for shares in the liquidity pool after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary, and you max out your shares after 10 years.

You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Gifts\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of every year, 37signals gives a thank-you gift to employees. The gift changes year to year and is not intended to be a year-end bonus.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees also receive a thank-you gift on their anniversaries with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Home Office Set-up\\\\n\\\\nSince you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. During your first year at 37signals, you can expense up to $2,000 on things like a new desk, new desk chair, or other office furniture. This benefit expires on your first anniversary with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Coworking Space Stipend\\\\n\\\\nYou can expense up to $200/month towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space like Soho House.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone at 37signals has a subscription to [Deskpass](https://www.deskpass.com), a co-working desk reservation service. You can use Deskpass to find co-working spaces near you, and your $200/month benefit is pre-fixed in your account. You’re not required to use Deskpass to use your co-working space benefit. Your Deskpass budget is capped at $200/mo, but none of that gets paid out unless you book a desk.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal 37signals Accounts\\\\n\\\\nAll employees can have a free personal Basecamp account and a free personal HEY account. We\\'ll comp your existing accounts during your on-boarding process when you join the company. If you decide to sign up for either account later, you can comp the accounts in QueenBee so you won\\'t be charged. Ping Andrea or Support if you need help with that.\\\\n\\\\n## Expense Account\\\\n\\\\nAll staff carry a 37signals Visa card that you can use for work expenses like the benefits described above, software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies. Check with your manager or Andrea if you have any doubts about whether or not a purchase qualifies as a work expense.\\\\n\\\\nWe use an expense management platform called [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com/). You’re responsible for the monthly categorizing of your expenses and uploading receipts for purchases over $75. Full instructions on how to log your expenses in Airbase can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5508145768).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a meet-up flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of 37signals, we’ll buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a great day to celebrate).\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of conferences — please limit your attendance at professional conferences to once a year. Don’t extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule; you should be traveling specifically to attend the conf. Our conference budget guidelines mirror our mini meet-up budget guidelines; you can find those in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4347682694).\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.2632947531288188}',\n",

What follows is a set of guidelines on how we get there.\\\\n\\\\nBehavior that contributes to a healthy and friendly work environment:\\\\n\\\\n- Using courteous language.\\\\n- Being respectful and empathetic, especially when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences.\\\\n- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and direct feedback, as well as offering it in that spirit.\\\\n- Assuming good intentions. Approaching work relationships with a default of trust and positivity.\\\\n\\\\nUnacceptable behavior:\\\\n\\\\n- The use of any sexualized language or imagery.\\\\n- The use of any violent language or imagery.\\\\n- Making unwelcome sexual advances or giving unwanted sexual attention.\\\\n- Any form of discrimination and harassment. Particularly on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.\\\\n\\\\nThese expectations apply to all current employees. Unacceptable employee conduct will not be tolerated virtually (e.g. in Basecamp, GitHub) or at in-person events.\\\\n\\\\n## Reporting\\\\n\\\\nIf you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to leadership via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.\\\\n\\\\nIf an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or even termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.\\\\n\\\\nIn extreme circumstances, you can [report an incident anonymously](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4177996672). Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.\\\\n\\\\nAn important note: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for the kind of unacceptable behavior outlined above and other serious transgressions — illegal or egregiously unethical behavior.\\\\n\\\\n## Some Definitions & Resources\\\\n\\\\n- [Discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/discrimination-type)\\\\n- [Harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment)\\\\n- [Sexual Harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment)\\\\n- [Retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals Code of Conduct is not meant to be a replacement for your EEO rights.

We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Gifts\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of every year, 37signals gives a thank-you gift to employees. The gift changes year to year and is not intended to be a year-end bonus.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees also receive a thank-you gift on their anniversaries with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Home Office Set-up\\\\n\\\\nSince you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. During your first year at 37signals, you can expense up to $2,000 on things like a new desk, new desk chair, or other office furniture. This benefit expires on your first anniversary with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Coworking Space Stipend\\\\n\\\\nYou can expense up to $200/month towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space like Soho House.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone at 37signals has a subscription to [Deskpass](https://www.deskpass.com), a co-working desk reservation service. You can use Deskpass to find co-working spaces near you, and your $200/month benefit is pre-fixed in your account. You’re not required to use Deskpass to use your co-working space benefit. Your Deskpass budget is capped at $200/mo, but none of that gets paid out unless you book a desk.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal 37signals Accounts\\\\n\\\\nAll employees can have a free personal Basecamp account and a free personal HEY account. We\\'ll comp your existing accounts during your on-boarding process when you join the company. If you decide to sign up for either account later, you can comp the accounts in QueenBee so you won\\'t be charged. Ping Andrea or Support if you need help with that.\\\\n\\\\n## Expense Account\\\\n\\\\nAll staff carry a 37signals Visa card that you can use for work expenses like the benefits described above, software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies. Check with your manager or Andrea if you have any doubts about whether or not a purchase qualifies as a work expense.\\\\n\\\\nWe use an expense management platform called [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com/). You’re responsible for the monthly categorizing of your expenses and uploading receipts for purchases over $75. Full instructions on how to log your expenses in Airbase can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5508145768).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a meet-up flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of 37signals, we’ll buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a great day to celebrate).\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of conferences — please limit your attendance at professional conferences to once a year. Don’t extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule; you should be traveling specifically to attend the conf. Our conference budget guidelines mirror our mini meet-up budget guidelines; you can find those in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4347682694).\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.509395908052219}',\n",
       "     \"{'file': '37signals-is-you.md', 'content': '# 37signals Is You\\\\n\\\\nEveryone working at 37signals represents 37signals. When a customer gets a response from Merissa on support, Merissa is 37signals. When a customer reads a tweet by Eron that our systems are down, Eron is 37signals. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.\\\\n\\\\nThe vast majority of our customers come from word of mouth and much of that word comes from people in our audience. This is an audience we’ve been educating and entertaining for 20 years and counting, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not! Tell us and our audience what you have to say!\\\\n\\\\nThis goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. 37signals not only tries to out-teach the competition, but also out-share and out-collaborate. We’re prolific open source contributors through Ruby on Rails, Trix, Turbolinks, Stimulus, and many other projects. Extracting the common infrastructure that others could use as well is satisfying, important work, and we should continue to do that.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s also worth mentioning that joining 37signals can be all-consuming. We’ve seen it happen. You dig 37signals, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here’s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We’re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it’s a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We’ll all be better for it.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.44727584102407225}\",\n",

We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you\\'re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n\\\\nThere are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we\\'ve produced [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.\", \\'similarity\\': 0.44233179314922944}',\n",

This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5775640041568206}\",\n",

       "   'output': {'answer': \"Basecamp assists growing companies in managing their growth and staying organized by providing a central place where they can organize their projects, internal communications, and client work. This consolidated approach to managing different aspects of a business helps in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Central Source of Truth:** With projects, communications, and client work all in one place, team members always know what to do, where to find information, and how things are progressing. This clarity reduces confusion and ensures everyone is on the same page.\\n\\n2. **Improved Accountability:** When tasks and responsibilities are clearly listed and accessible, it's easier for team members to stay accountable for their contributions.\\n\\n3. **Better Communication:** As businesses grow, communication can become muddled, which Basecamp addresses by providing structured channels for company-wide and team-based communication. This reduces the need for excessive meetings and emails, which can become inefficient at scale.\\n\\n4. **Organization Amidst Growth:** Growth can lead to disorganization, with information getting harder to find and tasks more difficult to track. Basecamp's tools for project and task management help prevent this disarray, ensuring a business can scale without losing control of its operations.\\n\\n5. **Adaptability:** Basecamp is designed to grow with businesses, offering a sustainable solution to organizational challenges that evolve as a company expands.\\n\\nBy integrating these functionalities into a single platform, Basecamp helps small businesses deal with the challenges of growth, maintaining a smooth operational flow, and keeping teams aligned and focused on their goals.\",\n",
       "    'contexts': [\"{'file': 'what-we-stand-for.md', 'content': '# What We Stand For\\\\n\\\\n## Values\\\\n\\\\nBefore anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything’s harder when we all believe different things about what’s important to *us*, our company.\\\\n\\\\nKey values:\\\\n\\\\n* **Be Straightforward.** Whenever we speak — internally or externally — we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn’t mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but it’s got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Don’t use eight words when five will do.\\\\n\\\\n* **Be fair and do the right thing.** What’s fair? What’s the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone’s judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is “what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help?” An example might be providing a refund even if it’s a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says “Sure we can do that for you” when a customer expected you to say “sorry, we can’t.” If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it.\\\\n\\\\n* **Levelheadedness**. We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don’t act out of spite, we don’t rush to judgment, we don’t jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly — directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure.\\\\n\\\\n* **Generosity.** Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure — we give what we’re expected to, and then some.\\\\n\\\\n* **Independence.** This one’s a bit of a contradiction. After speaking about shared values, here’s one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking. Since day one, we’ve always done things our way. We don’t look to the industry or our competitors for the way forward. We see things with our own eyes, make our own calls, and offer thoughts, perspectives, ideas, and products that *we* think are right, not that *they* think are right.\\\\n\\\\n## Helping small businesses deal with growth\\\\n\\\\nGrowth happens.\\\\n\\\\nGrowth makes a lot of things more difficult — people don’t know each other as well, information is harder to find, stuff gets lost, communication becomes muddled, it becomes harder to stay on top of everything that’s going on, etc. What worked for 3 or 5 people, doesn’t work as well at 6 or 8. And certainly not 10, 15, 25 or more.\\\\n\\\\nAt some point, growing small businesses need a system, something to stay organized, something to grow with so they don’t lose control of themselves along the way. Company-wide communication, team-based communication, and project work needs a home.\\\\n\\\\nMost companies cobble together a latticework of separate tools as they grow, but the weight of disorganization and lack of order collapses and eventually catches up to them. Email doesn’t cut it anymore. More meetings aren’t going to solve the problem. And increasingly, incessant chatting creates exponentially more communication without the necessary structure and context to make it useful.\\\\n\\\\nThis is where Basecamp comes in.\\\\n\\\\nBasecamp helps growing companies organize their projects, internal communications, and client work *in one place* so they have a central source of truth. People know what to do, they know where things are, it’s clear where things stand, and everyone is accountable.\\\\n\\\\nThis is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards a more perfect system, but we help groups of people get their shit together — and keep it together — so they can do their best work with their team, in their company, for their own customers.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.7007891580146546}\",\n",
       "     \"{'file': 'product-histories.md', 'content': '# Product Histories\\\\n\\\\n## Basecamp\\\\n\\\\n[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/). On our website, we say _Basecamp is a private, secure space online where people working together can organize and discuss everything they need to get a project done. See it, track it, discuss it, act on it. Tasks, discussions, deadlines, and files — everything’s predictably organized in Basecamp_. But we want it to be more than that. In mid-2016, we decided to focus on helping small business owners manage their businesses and help alleviate growth and organizational pains they’re facing. Project management was our bread and butter for over 15 years. But we were inspired by how we, internally, have used Basecamp to run 37signals, and we want to extend that philosophy to our current customers and scores of brand-new customers.\\\\n\\\\nBut let’s take a look back. In 2003, 37signals was a web design firm made up of 4 people. We always had work, but we were disorganized. With so many concurrent projects, things began to slip through the cracks. Projects dragged on too long. We dropped the ball on key deliverables. We had some major miscommunication. As many people even still do, we relied on email for everything. Things inevitably got lost, people get left out of conversations, there’s nowhere to go to see what’s left to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo we started looking for a project management tool. We tried a few tools, but they were complicated and didn’t fit what we needed. Frustrated, we decided to build our own simple project management app. A few months later we had something ready, and we immediately started using this tool with our existing clients.\\\\n\\\\nLo and behold, our projects ran better! We regained the sense of order and calmness we’d been craving. And clients noticed — they really appreciated the improved communication and organization. Soon after, our clients started asking us what software we were using to run these projects. Turns out they wanted to use it for their own in-house projects! So, we polished it up and put it on the market. On February 5th, 2004, Basecamp was born, and within a year, Basecamp was generating more income for us than our web design business, so we shuttered the web design firm to focus solely on Basecamp. That original Basecamp is called Basecamp Classic, and it still retains quite a few loyal customers! In 2012, we released our second version of Basecamp, referred to as BCX.\\\\n\\\\nFast forward to 2014. We’d been feeling pulled in too many directions for too long. Campfire, Highrise, Backpack, and a host of other products were taking away from what we really wanted to do: maintain and improve Basecamp. So we spun off, sold, or otherwise sunset our ancillary products, and dedicated the entire company’s efforts to Basecamp. In 2015 we launched our third version of Basecamp, BC3, and in 2022, we launched Basecamp 4.\\\\n\\\\n## HEY\\\\n\\\\n[HEY](http://hey.com/) is our love letter to email. While our internal communications are almost exclusively in Basecamp (with code reviews in GitHub the primary exception), we still correspond with some external service providers and customers via email. Every time we needed to do that, we felt the drag: how much harder it was to manage and stay on top of email. So we eventually decided to do something about it. After over two years of work, we launched HEY in June 2020.\\\\n\\\\n## Highrise\\\\n\\\\nIn 2014, we decided to spin off or sell our other (very successful!) applications. One of those was Highrise, our customer relationship management (CRM) tool. Highrise became a subsidiary of 37signals run by its own board, executive, and staff. In 2018, we took back control of Highrise, disbanded the separate company, and turned off new signups. Highrise is now, as Basecamp Classic, Basecamp 2, Backpack, and Campfire, part of our until-the-end-of-the-internet legacy. Maintained for existing customers, but no longer developed for new features or new customers.\\\\n\\\\n## Ta-da List\\\\n\\\\nTen years ago, to-do list apps were few and far between. So, we created Ta-da List as a stand alone free subscription app at tadalist.com in January 2005. Now that people have to-do lists on their phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, and refrigerator doors, we recognized that Ta-da List was a little outdated. We closed new signups to tadalist.com in 2012, but existing customers were able to retain their accounts.\\\\n\\\\n## Backpack\\\\n\\\\nWe created Backpack in May 2005 as a supplement to Basecamp Classic. Backpack existed as an organizer: “a place to keep life’s loose ends together”. Users could make lists, notes, add files, upload pictures, and create Writeboards to share with other users. When we restructured in 2014, we closed Backpack to new customers, but existing customers still use (and love!) Backpack.\\\\n\\\\n## Writeboard\\\\n\\\\nA tool called Writeboards lives in Basecamp Classic and Backpack. A Writeboard functions as a very simple, minimally formattable text document. In October 2005, we launched Writeboards.com, so people who wanted to use the tool without a Basecamp or Backpack subscription could do so. We retired Writeboards.com in 2014, but they still work in existing Basecamp Classic and Backpack accounts.\\\\n\\\\n## Campfire\\\\n\\\\nIn 2006, we built Campfire to help businesses communicate better. It’s a simple, real-time web-based group chat tool that lets people set up password-protected chat rooms super quickly. At the very beginning, it didn’t integrate with Basecamp, but when it did, it took off. Signups for Campfire were closed in February 2017.\\\\n\\\\n## 37signals Suite\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals Suite was a bundle of Basecamp Classic, Highrise, Backpack, and Campfire that allowed businesses to get big savings across the apps, simplify billing, and unify users across the apps. We retired the 37signals Suite offering after BCX was launched.\\\\n\\\\n## Breeze\\\\n\\\\nIn 2012, we launched Echo, which turned into Breeze, a mailing list tool for small groups. We were excited about it, tried for a year to build up the product and bring in customers, but the product didn’t take off like we hoped it would. Only about 1,200 customers signed up in that year, so rather than watch it limp along, we closed it down in August 2013.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike our other retired products, we refunded our customers’ money and closed the product entirely so not even existing customers could retain their subscription. We directed them to other small scale mailing list alternatives and apologized for the hiccup.\\\\n\\\\n## WeWorkRemotely.com\\\\n\\\\n37signals has run a job board since 2006, helping connect small businesses with good designers and programmers for full-time jobs, freelance gigs, and internships.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2014, 37signals revamped our job board and launched We Work Remotely. After Jason and David published their book REMOTE, we realized we wanted to be on the forefront of promoting remote work. So, we created and hosted WeWorkRemotely.com, which contains job postings for programmers, designers, marketing professionals, customer service representatives, writers, and more — all remote work positions. We posted thousands of jobs over the years we ran WWR. In spring 2017, we sold We Work Remotely to Metalab, to cut down on manual labor taken to run the board and focus more on our core business.\\\\n\\\\n## Sortfolio.com\\\\n\\\\nIn 2009, 37signals launched Sortfolio (previously named Haystack) to help clients find the right web designer in a more efficient way. Clients are able to filter by city and typical budget range and then peruse the results in a more visual way. We ended up selling Sortfolio in 2013 to be able to focus more on Basecamp and allow another company to give Sortfolio the love and attention it deserves.\\\\n\\\\n## Know Your Team (formerly Know Your Company)\\\\n\\\\nIn 2013, 37signals created a software tool that allows managers to ask questions to gain insight into what their employees think about work, the culture, the direction of the company, what people are working on, or even something personal like their favorite recent movie. We created Know Your Team because when the 37signals team grew to about 30 people, Jason realized he didn’t know the company or its people as well as he should have. So, Know Your Team was created initially as an internal tool that eventually became a product that we sold to customers.

They are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n### Dash\\\\n\\\\nDash is the main hub for everything that has to do with logging (like finding why a request is slow or whether an email has been delivered), reporting (everything from number of support cases handled to split of devices used to access Basecamp), application health (response times, job queue exceptions etc).\\\\n\\\\n[dash.37signals.com](https://dash.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Queenbee\\\\n\\\\nQueenbee is our invoice, accounting, and identity system. Here you can look up any customer account, see whether they are comped, refund an invoice, or even login as a customer.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s an immense amount of power and we take its use very seriously. We only ever login as a customer after having been given explicit permission to do so, never preemptively. Our customers expect that their information is confidential, even from us, and we intend to honor that expectation at all times.\\\\n\\\\n[billing.37signals.com](https://billing.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### The 37 command\\\\n\\\\nThis is perhaps less of a system and more of an interface to all our other systems. The 37 command gives easy access to the production consoles for all the applications, which is often needed when diagnosing or fixing custom issues. It also allows you to directly grep and tail log files for live debugging, amongst other things.\\\\n\\\\n[github.com/basecamp/37](https://github.com/basecamp/37)\\\\n\\\\n### Sentry\\\\n\\\\nWe track programming exceptions on Sentry. When a customer hits a “Oops, something went wrong!” screen, that means there’ll be an entry in Sentry explaining to programmers why they saw that screen. Keeping the exceptions under control and monitored is primarily the responsibility of SIP and Jim via on-call.\\\\n\\\\n[getsentry.com](https://getsentry.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Kandji\\\\n\\\\n[Kandji](https://kandji.com) is how we make sure all work laptops are securely configured and running the latest software updates.

       "   'output': {'answer': \"37signals handles underperforming employees through a structured Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) process. The process is designed to address and correct performance issues that are deemed correctable in the short term and does not usually initiate PIPs for fundamental issues related to core job skills. Here are the key steps and components of this process:\\n\\n1. **Identify and Document**: The manager identifies the productivity or disciplinary problem and documents it. This can be a specific incident or a general problem with ongoing performance. The manager will then have a conversation with the employee about the specific problem, the steps required for correction, and a timeline for these corrections.\\n\\n2. **Revisit Throughout Timeline & On Deadline**: The timeline for correcting performance is at the manager's discretion. Throughout this period, the manager and employee will have periodic check-ins to discuss whether the expected improvement is being observed. At the end of the PIP timeline, there will be a formal check-in. If the employee's performance has improved to the expected level, the PIP process concludes. If the performance has not improved sufficiently, next steps are considered, which can include extending the PIP timeline or, in some cases, termination of employment.\\n\\n3. **Additional Support**: The process emphasized the importance of support from the manager during the PIP, acknowledging that personal or professional issues can affect performance. Employees are encouraged to communicate such issues so they can be addressed collaboratively.\\n\\n4. **Termination and Severance**: If an employee's performance does not improve and they are terminated, they are offered a severance package based on their tenure with the company, including additional benefits such as health insurance continuation and compensation for unused vacation and sabbatical time.\\n\\n5. **Exceptions**: The document mentions exceptions for cases where performance issues are so severe that they warrant immediate termination or bypass the steps of the PIP process. These are typically situations involving negligence, fraud, or insubordination.\\n\\nThis process reflects 37signals' approach to handling underperformance, emphasizing correction and support wherever possible, with termination and severance as a last resort.\",\n",
       "    'contexts': ['{\\'file\\': \\'performance-plans.md\\', \\'content\\': \"# Performance Improvement Plan Process\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not usually initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are the steps your manager will take at 37signals when they identify a problem with your performance that must be addressed with a performance improvement plan (PIP).\\\\n\\\\n## Identify and Document\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will identify a productivity or disciplinary problem as soon as possible after it occurs if it’s a specific incident, or as soon as they can when they sense a general problem with your ongoing performance. Your formal reviews may be helpful in identifying a problem, but managers shouldn’t wait for those reviews to raise a problem with you.\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will have a conversation with you about:\\\\n\\\\n1. the specific problem\\\\n2. the steps required for you to correct\\\\n3. the timeline for correction\\\\n\\\\n## Revisit Throughout Timeline & On Deadline\\\\n\\\\nYour timeline for taking steps to correct your performance is at the discretion of your manager. During that timeframe, you and your manager will check in periodically about whether or not they’re seeing the improvement they’ve asked to see.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you come to the end of your PIP timeline, you and your manager will have a formal check-in. If your performance is back where it should be, that’s the end of this process.\\\\n\\\\nIf your performance is _not_ where it should be, your manager will outline next steps. If they feel you’re putting forth good effort and could use more time to show improvement, they may extend the timeline of the PIP. If your manager feels your performance has not improved at all and you haven’t met the requirements outlined in your PIP, they may decide to terminate your employment with 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are terminated, you’ll be offered a severance package. If you\\'ve been with the company for less than 1 year, you\\'ll be offered 4 weeks severance pay. After a year, you\\'ll be offered an additional 2 weeks of severance pay for every 6 months of employment over 1 year, with a maximum of 6 months of severance pay. The package also includes health insurance for you and your dependents if you’ve been on our policies for the same time periods, compensation for unused vacation time, and compensation for unused sabbatical time if applicable (1 year look back). Compensation for all pay categories is calculated using your hourly rate. In return, you’ll be asked for a general release of liabilities and other standard employment termination terms. When you begin looking for work, your manager may provide references, if desired.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s the most important detail missing from the above process?\\\\n\\\\n_Support._\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will offer extra support during the PIP process. We know lots of external factors can come into play at work. If you’re having personal or professional issues that are harming your performance, please tell your manager so they can work with you.\\\\n\\\\nLots of employees who still work at 37signals have been on PIPs. We’re not in the game of high turnover. We want to see you through the process and see you come out energized on the other side. We care about everyone who works here and if you’re having performance issues, our first reaction is to help you. We only ask that you work with us to devise a realistic improvement plan that elevates you _and_ works for 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n## Exceptions\\\\n\\\\nThe process outlined above is for employees who are dealing with manageable performance or disciplinary issues. If an employee is negligent in their duties or commits fraud or insubordination to the point that a performance plan won’t serve 37signals or the employee, we retain the right to immediately terminate at-will as stated in our employment contracts. 37signals also retains the right to bypass steps outlined above, including offering a severance package, if the severity of performance problems warrants that. In either of these cases, the reasoning will be spelled out in detail to the employee prior to termination.\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.5804210261819127}',\n",
       "     \"{'file': 'making-a-career.md', 'content': '# Making A Career\\\\n\\\\n## Your First 90 Days\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations! You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5598151993687646}\",\n",

       "    'contexts': [\"{'file': 'international-travel-guide.md', 'content': '# International Travel Guide\\\\n\\\\nIf you travel out of your country of residence with your work laptop or other devices, you may face questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border security. We have answers!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you travel for 37signals business, here’s what you need:\\\\n\\\\n1. Your passport! Apply for one now if you don’t have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six months.\\\\n2. A travel visa, waiver, or an electronic travel authorization. 37signals will cover the cost of any documentation you need to travel on 37signals business.\\\\n3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.\\\\n4. Your lodging address and contact info.\\\\n5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone. Clearing work data from your devices is *required* before crossing any border.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nYou need a visa or a waiver to authorize travel to the US. If your country participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), then you can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) within 3 days of travel. The ESTA is valid for 2 years. [Apply for an ESTA here](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/).\\\\n\\\\nCanadian passport holders don’t need a visa to enter the US for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are all that’s required.\\\\n\\\\n### B-1 Business Visitor Visa\\\\n\\\\nIf your country does not participate in the Visa Waiver Program or you are not eligible for an ESTA, you’ll need to apply for a B-1 business visitor visa… the long way.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll work with you through this process. Start early, as soon as we have dates for a meet-up or conference. Visa appointments and processing can take weeks to months. Ping Andrea as soon as you know that you’ll need a visa.\\\\n\\\\n### Trusted Traveler Programs\\\\n\\\\nCitizens of some countries are eligible for [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/frequently-asked-questions) and Canadians are eligible for [NEXUS](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus/nexus-eligibility). These programs are completely optional but may make life a little easier, at the cost of onerous biometric scans like fingerprinting (for Global Entry and NEXUS) and iris scanning (for NEXUS). Note: An ESTA is still required for travel; these programs just speed up entry.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to countries other than the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nThe visa requirements for your nationality will vary depending on the country you plan to visit, as individual visa policies and requirements vary for different foreign citizens. It may or may not be necessary to obtain a travel document to visit your country of destination.\\\\n\\\\nPlease check the requirements for your nationality with your destination country as far in advance of travel as you can. You can also use a [visa checker](https://www.onlinevisa.com/visa-requirements/). You may be able to travel visa-free, or you may need to obtain a visa, a waiver, or an electronic travel authorization.\\\\n\\\\n### Invitation Letter\\\\n\\\\nTo substantiate the purpose of your travel to any country, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you’re traveling on behalf of 37signals business. Verify in advance if the country you’re visiting *requires* a letter of purpose, and that you won’t need a work visa to accompany a letter.\\\\n\\\\n## Company Security at Border Crossings\\\\n\\\\nWhen you cross a border, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.\\\\n\\\\nWhat’s a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with source code; your tablet where you read work email; your phone where you use the Basecamp app; etc.\\\\n\\\\n### TL;DR: Don’t Travel With Work Data\\\\n\\\\n* If you don’t need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don’t bring it with you!\\\\n* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: Before You Travel\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the US.\\\\n* Update your electronic travel authorization with your travel info when you have it.\\\\n* Ensure you have your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.\\\\n* If you run into general travel issues while on 37signals business, contact Andrea.\\\\n* If you find yourself facing serious consequences like arrest or illegal detention in the United States, you can contact our attorney Jennifer Schaaf. Her contact information is in the teams vault in 1Password. You should also contact your home country’s embassy or consulate; please save that phone number prior to travel.\\\\n* If you’re traveling to a country with privacy laws that concern you, please raise that concern internally with Andrea before you travel so we can discuss putting protections in place, including connecting you with a local, on-call attorney.\\\\n* 1Password\\\\n  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn’t have any work logins. If it does, move them to the team vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the 37signals team which is perfect for those logins.\\\\n  * Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.\\\\n  * Open 1Password on each device you’re traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it’s in Travel Mode.\\\\n* HEY\\\\n  * [Log out of HEY on all sessions.](https://app.hey.com/my/sessions)\\\\n* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.\\\\n  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.\\\\n  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data\\\\n  * [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data. Check Cookies and site data; uncheck all the other items. > Clear data.\\\\n* Source code.\\\\n  * Make an encrypted archive on an external hard drive of your git repos so you can download and restore it after you’re through customs. Here are [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) for doing that if you’re running a Mac OS. Please perform an equally secure file encryption for Windows or Linux OS & check with SIP if you’re unsure how to do that.\\\\n  * Delete all source code from your laptop.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents.\\\\n  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup on your external drive and remove from your laptop. Please refrain from using iCloud for any files/repos.\\\\n* Dropbox\\\\n  * Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.\\\\n* Touch ID (optional)\\\\n  * Unlocking your device can be compelled at US border crossings, but other countries may be less intrusive, so it may make sense to make your device a little harder to unlock.\\\\n  * Disable Touch ID or Face ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: At Customs\\\\n\\\\n* Have ready your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details including the address of where you’ll be staying.\\\\n* Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.\\\\n* Common questions:\\\\n  * Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting in *city*.\\\\n  * Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with 37signals.\\\\n  * Where are you staying? Lodging name, address, phone number.\\\\n* Be straightforward and truthful. You’re legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Arrive\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know when you’ve arrived at your destination and have cleared airport security.\\\\n* Touch ID / Face ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Basecamp app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Disable Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you’ll have full access again.\\\\n* HEY: Log back in on your device(s).\\\\n* Source code: Download and restore the archive of your git repos, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Return\\\\n\\\\n* Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the US.\\\\n\\\\n## Any Questions?\\\\n\\\\nHitting a snag or have any questions? Ping Jeremy or Andrea and we can help.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.681956033432088}\",\n",
       "     '{\\'file\\': \\'managing-work-devices.md\\', \\'content\\': \"# Managing work devices\\\\n\\\\nEveryone receives a new Mac [when they join 37signals](https://basecamp.com/handbook/08-getting-started#your-first-few-days). We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you\\'re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n\\\\nThere are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we\\'ve produced [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.\", \\'similarity\\': 0.5277544783502284}',\n",

The company pays 75% of the premium and the employee pays the other 25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\nEach pay period, you’ll see a payroll deduction for medical insurance:\\\\n\\\\n* Employee-only medical coverage: $76.93\\\\n* Employee-partner medical coverage: $160.26\\\\n* Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $171.29\\\\n* Employee-family medical coverage: $254.61\\\\n\\\\n### Dental Insurance\\\\n\\\\nDental insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Vision Insurance\\\\n\\\\nVision insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Health Insurance for Staff Outside the US\\\\nIf you’re outside of the US and pay out of pocket for private health insurance, you can request reimbursement for 75% of your insurance payments on your monthly invoice. Your monthly reimbursement is capped at the amount 37signals pays per employee per month on the US employee group plan. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for reimbursement.\\\\n\\\\n### Life Insurance\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers a $400,000 life insurance/AD+D policy to all staff through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and it’s terminated automatically on your final day of employment. Open enrollment is in November every year, and participants are auto-enrolled at that time.\\\\n\\\\n## Retirement Plan\\\\n\\\\nOur retirement plan for US employees is with Vanguard. 37signals matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 6% of your salary. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan with your first paycheck.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re outside the US, 37signals will match what you contribute to a retirement account in your home country, up to 6% of your salary. In these cases, 37signals will pay you directly via your monthly invoice. It’s up to you to invest that payment and maintain administration of the retirement account and its taxes. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for a match.\\\\n\\\\n## Flexible Spending Account (FSA)\\\\n\\\\nThe FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $3,050/year. There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care, and the max for that plan is $5,000/year or $2,500/year if you split this with a partner. This is an entirely optional program. Open enrollment is in December every year, with new coverage beginning January 1. Both FSAs are with Paychex, our payroll provider.\\\\n\\\\n## Paid Time Off\\\\n\\\\n### Vacation Time\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers 18 days of paid time off plus [11 local holidays](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5061131347) every year. We ask that you [track your time off](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/projects/14971171). Your vacation time is prorated based on your start date during your first year at 37signals. Your vacation time rolls over year to year with a maximum bank of 27 days at any time. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals with vacation days in your bank, you’ll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (prorated at the time of your departure).\\\\n\\\\n### Sabbatical\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to annual PTO and holidays, every *three* years employees may take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Give your team a heads-up preferably three months in advance so they can coordinate. If you’re terminated or resign from 37signals with an unused sabbatical, 37signals will pay you the monetary equivalent of those unused days only if your unused sabbatical was earned within the previous 12 months.\\\\n\\\\n### Sick Time\\\\n\\\\nWe don’t offer a bank of sick days nor do we ask you to track your sick days. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to Personal Leave. 37signals does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination, since we have no sick time bank.\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures. If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your manager for accommodations.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you are unable to work for more than 1 week because of illness or injury, let your manager know as soon as you can. You can take four weeks off at 100% pay. If after 4 weeks, you’re still unable to work, your salary will drop to 70% for an additional 8 weeks. Your medical insurance will remain in force throughout your Leave. If after 12 weeks, you still cannot work, talk to your manager, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis. You may be asked to provide medical documentation to support your request for Personal Leave, and Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave per 12-month period.\\\\n\\\\n### Summer Hours\\\\n\\\\nWe work 4-day work weeks from May 1 through August 31 every year. An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible. When a holiday occurs during summer hours, you can take the holiday off *or* your normal summer day off. Any additional days off would count as vacation days.\\\\n\\\\n### Day of Service\\\\n\\\\n37signals also allows a Day of Service. You can take one day off every year to volunteer for a charitable or community organization of your choice. No need to use a vacation day or personal day, just let your team know you’ll be out. 37signals does not pay out for unused Days of Service if you resign or are terminated from 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n### Scheduling Time Off\\\\n\\\\n37signals doesn’t have a formal time off request process. It’s your responsibility to work with your manager and team to ensure coverage and manage your scheduled workload. The sooner you can inform your manager and team of your planned absence, the better, especially longer absences like sabbatical or long vacations. If your team has a defined process for scheduling time off, please follow that first.\\\\n\\\\nThe only time we ask you *not* to schedule discretionary time off is during a CODE. At 37signals, we assign a CODE when urgent work needs to be done. We have three levels of criticality. A CODE RED is an emergency, a CODE YELLOW is less immediate but still critical, and a CODE LAUNCH is called when we’re in the final stages of launching a new product. If we’re in the midst of one of these and you can delay your vacation or sabbatical until after the code has ended, please do.\\\\n\\\\n## Family Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you become the primary caregiver of a child, you can take up to 16 weeks leave at 100% pay. If you become the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% pay. You may choose to take an additional unpaid leave as the primary or secondary caregiver.\\\\n\\\\nSome states require us to provide additional [benefits](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/stateFMLA.md#new-york).\\\\n\\\\n## Bereavement Leave\\\\n\\\\nWhen you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.\\\\n\\\\nYou can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know you’ll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your manager to discuss that special case.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals EAP is through ComPsych, and it provides a *confidential* avenue for you to get assistance with issues regarding health, family, legal, financial, wellness or other personal matters. When you call or email ComPsych, you’ll be connected to a certified representative who can help you one-on-one at that time, or who can refer you to someone in your area for longer-term help. Services range from immediate or crisis mental health care to phone-help on your 401k investments to a referral to a lawyer in your area to help with your estate planning. Because we use the EAP, you also receive discounts on those referrals to professionals.\\\\n\\\\n## Pet Insurance\\\\n\\\\nFor your fur babies! 37signals doesn’t contribute to this plan at all, but everyone gets a 10% discount on this insurance you might otherwise buy. There are no set rates, and you can visit our portal on [Figo’s website](https://figopetinsurance.com) to get your quote and sign up. There’s no open enrollment period to sign up for pet insurance.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Profit Sharing\\\\n\\\\n37signals shares 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2022 profits distributed in March 2023).\\\\n\\\\nYou’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary at 37signals, and you’ll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nWe ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon, not something to be budgeted with, but as a true bonus. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount we’re able to share with employees may swing wildly or not be paid out at all.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Liquidity Pool\\\\n\\\\nThere are no plans to sell 37signals or take the company public! But, in the slight chance of that happening, employees may be eligible to receive a portion of 10% of the value of the company if 37signals is sold or made public. That 10% would be divided into shares, and shares distributed amongst employees based on their tenure at the time of the sale/offering.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees are eligible for shares in the liquidity pool after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary, and you max out your shares after 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Gifts\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of every year, 37signals gives a thank-you gift to employees. The gift changes year to year and is not intended to be a year-end bonus.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees also receive a thank-you gift on their anniversaries with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Home Office Set-up\\\\n\\\\nSince you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. During your first year at 37signals, you can expense up to $2,000 on things like a new desk, new desk chair, or other office furniture. This benefit expires on your first anniversary with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Coworking Space Stipend\\\\n\\\\nYou can expense up to $200/month towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space like Soho House.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone at 37signals has a subscription to [Deskpass](https://www.deskpass.com), a co-working desk reservation service. You can use Deskpass to find co-working spaces near you, and your $200/month benefit is pre-fixed in your account. You’re not required to use Deskpass to use your co-working space benefit. Your Deskpass budget is capped at $200/mo, but none of that gets paid out unless you book a desk.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal 37signals Accounts\\\\n\\\\nAll employees can have a free personal Basecamp account and a free personal HEY account. We\\'ll comp your existing accounts during your on-boarding process when you join the company. If you decide to sign up for either account later, you can comp the accounts in QueenBee so you won\\'t be charged. Ping Andrea or Support if you need help with that.\\\\n\\\\n## Expense Account\\\\n\\\\nAll staff carry a 37signals Visa card that you can use for work expenses like the benefits described above, software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies. Check with your manager or Andrea if you have any doubts about whether or not a purchase qualifies as a work expense.\\\\n\\\\nWe use an expense management platform called [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com/). You’re responsible for the monthly categorizing of your expenses and uploading receipts for purchases over $75. Full instructions on how to log your expenses in Airbase can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5508145768).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a meet-up flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of 37signals, we’ll buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a great day to celebrate).\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of conferences — please limit your attendance at professional conferences to once a year. Don’t extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule; you should be traveling specifically to attend the conf. Our conference budget guidelines mirror our mini meet-up budget guidelines; you can find those in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4347682694).\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.4725614152055391}',\n",

Approaching work relationships with a default of trust and positivity.\\\\n\\\\nUnacceptable behavior:\\\\n\\\\n- The use of any sexualized language or imagery.\\\\n- The use of any violent language or imagery.\\\\n- Making unwelcome sexual advances or giving unwanted sexual attention.\\\\n- Any form of discrimination and harassment. Particularly on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.\\\\n\\\\nThese expectations apply to all current employees. Unacceptable employee conduct will not be tolerated virtually (e.g. in Basecamp, GitHub) or at in-person events.\\\\n\\\\n## Reporting\\\\n\\\\nIf you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to leadership via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.\\\\n\\\\nIf an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or even termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.\\\\n\\\\nIn extreme circumstances, you can [report an incident anonymously](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4177996672). Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.\\\\n\\\\nAn important note: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for the kind of unacceptable behavior outlined above and other serious transgressions — illegal or egregiously unethical behavior.\\\\n\\\\n## Some Definitions & Resources\\\\n\\\\n- [Discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/discrimination-type)\\\\n- [Harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment)\\\\n- [Sexual Harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment)\\\\n- [Retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals Code of Conduct is not meant to be a replacement for your EEO rights.

This configuration includes enabling disk encryption, setting up a firewall, establishing password rules, installing essential apps (e.g., EncryptMe), and ensuring that the apps have the latest security updates applied. Additionally, Kandji allows for devices to be remotely wiped should they be lost or when an employee leaves the company.\\n\\nWhen personal and work data are mixed on a laptop, several hazards arise. Mixing personal and work use on a device that has access to sensitive systems can lead to security vulnerabilities. If a device needs to be wiped remotely due to security concerns or upon an employee's departure, there is a risk of personal data being destroyed. In the event of a hack, if forensics or device snapshots are required, it becomes problematic when personal data is involved. Similarly, during malware or secrets scanning, the company should not have to encounter personal documents, such as bank account details or government ID numbers. Furthermore, if work devices are turned over to a government because of a lawsuit, personal data should not be entangled in any legal investigations. Essentially, work computers are designated for work purposes to avoid these complications, and personal data and usage should be kept to personal devices.\",\n",

We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them.

They are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n### Dash\\\\n\\\\nDash is the main hub for everything that has to do with logging (like finding why a request is slow or whether an email has been delivered), reporting (everything from number of support cases handled to split of devices used to access Basecamp), application health (response times, job queue exceptions etc).\\\\n\\\\n[dash.37signals.com](https://dash.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Queenbee\\\\n\\\\nQueenbee is our invoice, accounting, and identity system. Here you can look up any customer account, see whether they are comped, refund an invoice, or even login as a customer.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s an immense amount of power and we take its use very seriously. We only ever login as a customer after having been given explicit permission to do so, never preemptively. Our customers expect that their information is confidential, even from us, and we intend to honor that expectation at all times.\\\\n\\\\n[billing.37signals.com](https://billing.37signals.com)\\\\n\\\\n### The 37 command\\\\n\\\\nThis is perhaps less of a system and more of an interface to all our other systems. The 37 command gives easy access to the production consoles for all the applications, which is often needed when diagnosing or fixing custom issues. It also allows you to directly grep and tail log files for live debugging, amongst other things.\\\\n\\\\n[github.com/basecamp/37](https://github.com/basecamp/37)\\\\n\\\\n### Sentry\\\\n\\\\nWe track programming exceptions on Sentry. When a customer hits a “Oops, something went wrong!” screen, that means there’ll be an entry in Sentry explaining to programmers why they saw that screen. Keeping the exceptions under control and monitored is primarily the responsibility of SIP and Jim via on-call.\\\\n\\\\n[getsentry.com](https://getsentry.com)\\\\n\\\\n### Kandji\\\\n\\\\n[Kandji](https://kandji.com) is how we make sure all work laptops are securely configured and running the latest software updates. It helps us reduce our exposure to security incidents. You can read more about this in [Managing work devices](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/managing-work-devices.md).\\\\n\\\\n### Shipshape\\\\n\\\\nShipshape is the OG in-house tool for ensuring your work laptop is safe and secure. We still run it, but it\\'s gradually being superceded by Kandji. When you’re given access to the company’s GitHub account, you can run Shipshape to be sure you’re up to code.

We have answers!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you travel for 37signals business, here’s what you need:\\\\n\\\\n1. Your passport! Apply for one now if you don’t have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six months.\\\\n2. A travel visa, waiver, or an electronic travel authorization. 37signals will cover the cost of any documentation you need to travel on 37signals business.\\\\n3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.\\\\n4. Your lodging address and contact info.\\\\n5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone. Clearing work data from your devices is *required* before crossing any border.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nYou need a visa or a waiver to authorize travel to the US. If your country participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), then you can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) within 3 days of travel. The ESTA is valid for 2 years. [Apply for an ESTA here](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/).\\\\n\\\\nCanadian passport holders don’t need a visa to enter the US for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are all that’s required.\\\\n\\\\n### B-1 Business Visitor Visa\\\\n\\\\nIf your country does not participate in the Visa Waiver Program or you are not eligible for an ESTA, you’ll need to apply for a B-1 business visitor visa… the long way.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll work with you through this process. Start early, as soon as we have dates for a meet-up or conference. Visa appointments and processing can take weeks to months. Ping Andrea as soon as you know that you’ll need a visa.\\\\n\\\\n### Trusted Traveler Programs\\\\n\\\\nCitizens of some countries are eligible for [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/frequently-asked-questions) and Canadians are eligible for [NEXUS](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus/nexus-eligibility). These programs are completely optional but may make life a little easier, at the cost of onerous biometric scans like fingerprinting (for Global Entry and NEXUS) and iris scanning (for NEXUS). Note: An ESTA is still required for travel; these programs just speed up entry.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to countries other than the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nThe visa requirements for your nationality will vary depending on the country you plan to visit, as individual visa policies and requirements vary for different foreign citizens. It may or may not be necessary to obtain a travel document to visit your country of destination.\\\\n\\\\nPlease check the requirements for your nationality with your destination country as far in advance of travel as you can. You can also use a [visa checker](https://www.onlinevisa.com/visa-requirements/). You may be able to travel visa-free, or you may need to obtain a visa, a waiver, or an electronic travel authorization.\\\\n\\\\n### Invitation Letter\\\\n\\\\nTo substantiate the purpose of your travel to any country, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you’re traveling on behalf of 37signals business. Verify in advance if the country you’re visiting *requires* a letter of purpose, and that you won’t need a work visa to accompany a letter.\\\\n\\\\n## Company Security at Border Crossings\\\\n\\\\nWhen you cross a border, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.\\\\n\\\\nWhat’s a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with source code; your tablet where you read work email; your phone where you use the Basecamp app; etc.\\\\n\\\\n### TL;DR: Don’t Travel With Work Data\\\\n\\\\n* If you don’t need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don’t bring it with you!\\\\n* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: Before You Travel\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the US.\\\\n* Update your electronic travel authorization with your travel info when you have it.\\\\n* Ensure you have your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.\\\\n* If you run into general travel issues while on 37signals business, contact Andrea.\\\\n* If you find yourself facing serious consequences like arrest or illegal detention in the United States, you can contact our attorney Jennifer Schaaf. Her contact information is in the teams vault in 1Password. You should also contact your home country’s embassy or consulate; please save that phone number prior to travel.\\\\n* If you’re traveling to a country with privacy laws that concern you, please raise that concern internally with Andrea before you travel so we can discuss putting protections in place, including connecting you with a local, on-call attorney.\\\\n* 1Password\\\\n  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn’t have any work logins. If it does, move them to the team vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the 37signals team which is perfect for those logins.\\\\n  * Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.\\\\n  * Open 1Password on each device you’re traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it’s in Travel Mode.\\\\n* HEY\\\\n  * [Log out of HEY on all sessions.](https://app.hey.com/my/sessions)\\\\n* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.\\\\n  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.\\\\n  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data\\\\n  * [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data.

Here are [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) for doing that if you’re running a Mac OS. Please perform an equally secure file encryption for Windows or Linux OS & check with SIP if you’re unsure how to do that.\\\\n  * Delete all source code from your laptop.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents.\\\\n  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup on your external drive and remove from your laptop. Please refrain from using iCloud for any files/repos.\\\\n* Dropbox\\\\n  * Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.\\\\n* Touch ID (optional)\\\\n  * Unlocking your device can be compelled at US border crossings, but other countries may be less intrusive, so it may make sense to make your device a little harder to unlock.\\\\n  * Disable Touch ID or Face ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: At Customs\\\\n\\\\n* Have ready your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details including the address of where you’ll be staying.\\\\n* Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.\\\\n* Common questions:\\\\n  * Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting in *city*.\\\\n  * Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with 37signals.\\\\n  * Where are you staying? Lodging name, address, phone number.\\\\n* Be straightforward and truthful. You’re legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Arrive\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know when you’ve arrived at your destination and have cleared airport security.\\\\n* Touch ID / Face ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Basecamp app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Disable Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you’ll have full access again.\\\\n* HEY: Log back in on your device(s).\\\\n* Source code: Download and restore the archive of your git repos, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Return\\\\n\\\\n* Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the US.\\\\n\\\\n## Any Questions?\\\\n\\\\nHitting a snag or have any questions?

       "   'output': {'answer': \"At 37signals, the promotion of independent project teams is deeply ingrained in the company's working culture, as outlined in their operational philosophy. Here's how they can encourage and enhance the self-sufficiency and independence of project teams:\\n\\n1. **Work in Cycles**: 37signals works in fixed cycles (typically 6 or 8 weeks), giving teams a clear timeframe to complete projects. This structure encourages teams to think critically about scope and deliverables, promoting a sense of urgency and efficiency within an autonomous framework.\\n\\n2. **Cooldown Periods**: Between cycles, there is a 'cooldown' period for teams to address bugs, reflect on the previous cycle, and plan the next. This built-in reflection and planning time supports a culture of continuous improvement and independence by allowing teams to self-assess and adapt their strategies.\\n\\n3. **Communication Mechanisms**: 37signals has established communication norms, like daily and weekly check-ins, heartbeats, and kickoffs, which foster a culture of openness and informed independence. By regularly sharing what they’re working on and planning, teams can operate independently with confidence, knowing they have the broader context and support when needed.\\n\\n4. **Pitches**: Any member of 37signals can suggest new features or projects via pitches. This democratizes the idea generation process, allowing project teams to form around compelling pitches and pursue new initiatives with broad organizational visibility and support.\\n\\n5. **Asynchronous Collaboration**: Given the diverse locations and work hours of its team members, 37signals emphasizes asynchronous work. This approach reduces dependencies and allows project teams to progress work without needing synchronous input, fostering a culture where teams can move forward autonomously while still staying aligned with overall goals.\\n\\n6. **Self-sufficient, Independent Teams:** The company’s preference for project over functional structure means project teams are empowered to handle a wide range of tasks from concept to deployment, minimizing bottlenecks and inter-department dependencies. Teams are encouraged to solve problems and implement solutions independently, promoting a strong sense of ownership and self-reliance.\\n\\n7. **Managers of One**: 37signals looks for individuals who are 'managers of one' – those who can manage themselves effectively. This philosophy underpins their approach to building project teams, as each member is expected to take initiative, manage their contributions, and drive progress without heavy oversight.\\n\\n8. **Emphasis on Autonomy in Organizational Theory**: 37signals consciously works to minimize organizational bottlenecks and encourages teams to operate in a way that they can move from idea to deployment as independently as possible. This is achieved by empowering teams with the tools, authority, and responsibility they need to execute their projects.\\n\\nBy embedding these principles into their operational framework, 37signals promotes a culture that not only values but actively cultivates independent project teams. This approach encourages innovation, efficiency, and job satisfaction among its employees, leading to a dynamic and effective organization.\",\n",

       "     \"{'file': 'how-we-work.md', 'content': '# How We Work\\\\n\\\\n## Cycles\\\\n\\\\nWe work in 6-week or 8-week cycles at 37signals. There are typically six cycles to a year. Two are 8-week cycles, during Summer Hours, and the rest 6-week cycles. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\\\\n\\\\nThis is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain — and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Cooldown\\\\n\\\\nIn between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That’s the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. It’s sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down”. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\\\\n\\\\n## Communication\\\\n\\\\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\\\\n\\\\nDaily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you’re only subscribed to your team’s answers. You’re of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you’re not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.\\\\n\\\\nThird, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\\\\n\\\\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\\\\n\\\\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\\\\n\\\\nAll these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year.\\\\n\\\\n## Pitches\\\\n\\\\nWhether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\\\\n\\\\nWrite-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\\\\n\\\\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\\\\n\\\\nWhile a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it’s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don’t be discouraged by this. We’ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening.\\\\n\\\\n## Asynchronously\\\\n\\\\nWe have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will).\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.\\\\n\\\\nIn certain departments, like Support and Ops, it’s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.\\\\n\\\\n## In self-sufficient, independent teams\\\\n\\\\nOrganizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn’t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don’t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means we can’t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn’t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for “the mobile integration”, we’re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. That’s a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.\\\\n\\\\n## With managers of one\\\\n\\\\nWe rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as [managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.\\\\n\\\\nThat means setting your own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\\\\n\\\\n## Balanced\\\\n\\\\nWe limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.\\\\n\\\\nThere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5253602643216542}\",\n",

What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that.

You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months.

No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5005297043200818}\",\n",

       "    'contexts': [\"{'file': 'international-travel-guide.md', 'content': '# International Travel Guide\\\\n\\\\nIf you travel out of your country of residence with your work laptop or other devices, you may face questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border security. We have answers!\\\\n\\\\nWhen you travel for 37signals business, here’s what you need:\\\\n\\\\n1. Your passport! Apply for one now if you don’t have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six months.\\\\n2. A travel visa, waiver, or an electronic travel authorization. 37signals will cover the cost of any documentation you need to travel on 37signals business.\\\\n3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.\\\\n4. Your lodging address and contact info.\\\\n5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone. Clearing work data from your devices is *required* before crossing any border.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nYou need a visa or a waiver to authorize travel to the US. If your country participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), then you can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) within 3 days of travel. The ESTA is valid for 2 years. [Apply for an ESTA here](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/).\\\\n\\\\nCanadian passport holders don’t need a visa to enter the US for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are all that’s required.\\\\n\\\\n### B-1 Business Visitor Visa\\\\n\\\\nIf your country does not participate in the Visa Waiver Program or you are not eligible for an ESTA, you’ll need to apply for a B-1 business visitor visa… the long way.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ll work with you through this process. Start early, as soon as we have dates for a meet-up or conference. Visa appointments and processing can take weeks to months. Ping Andrea as soon as you know that you’ll need a visa.\\\\n\\\\n### Trusted Traveler Programs\\\\n\\\\nCitizens of some countries are eligible for [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/frequently-asked-questions) and Canadians are eligible for [NEXUS](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus/nexus-eligibility). These programs are completely optional but may make life a little easier, at the cost of onerous biometric scans like fingerprinting (for Global Entry and NEXUS) and iris scanning (for NEXUS). Note: An ESTA is still required for travel; these programs just speed up entry.\\\\n\\\\n## Travel to countries other than the United States\\\\n\\\\n### Visa\\\\n\\\\nThe visa requirements for your nationality will vary depending on the country you plan to visit, as individual visa policies and requirements vary for different foreign citizens. It may or may not be necessary to obtain a travel document to visit your country of destination.\\\\n\\\\nPlease check the requirements for your nationality with your destination country as far in advance of travel as you can. You can also use a [visa checker](https://www.onlinevisa.com/visa-requirements/). You may be able to travel visa-free, or you may need to obtain a visa, a waiver, or an electronic travel authorization.\\\\n\\\\n### Invitation Letter\\\\n\\\\nTo substantiate the purpose of your travel to any country, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you’re traveling on behalf of 37signals business. Verify in advance if the country you’re visiting *requires* a letter of purpose, and that you won’t need a work visa to accompany a letter.\\\\n\\\\n## Company Security at Border Crossings\\\\n\\\\nWhen you cross a border, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to safeguard our data.\\\\n\\\\nWhat’s a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with source code; your tablet where you read work email; your phone where you use the Basecamp app; etc.\\\\n\\\\n### TL;DR: Don’t Travel With Work Data\\\\n\\\\n* If you don’t need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don’t bring it with you!\\\\n* Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: Before You Travel\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the US.\\\\n* Update your electronic travel authorization with your travel info when you have it.\\\\n* Ensure you have your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.\\\\n* If you run into general travel issues while on 37signals business, contact Andrea.\\\\n* If you find yourself facing serious consequences like arrest or illegal detention in the United States, you can contact our attorney Jennifer Schaaf. Her contact information is in the teams vault in 1Password. You should also contact your home country’s embassy or consulate; please save that phone number prior to travel.\\\\n* If you’re traveling to a country with privacy laws that concern you, please raise that concern internally with Andrea before you travel so we can discuss putting protections in place, including connecting you with a local, on-call attorney.\\\\n* 1Password\\\\n  * Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn’t have any work logins. If it does, move them to the team vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the 37signals team which is perfect for those logins.\\\\n  * Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.\\\\n  * Open 1Password on each device you’re traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it’s in Travel Mode.\\\\n* HEY\\\\n  * [Log out of HEY on all sessions.](https://app.hey.com/my/sessions)\\\\n* Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.\\\\n  * Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.\\\\n  * [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data\\\\n  * [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data.

Here are [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) for doing that if you’re running a Mac OS. Please perform an equally secure file encryption for Windows or Linux OS & check with SIP if you’re unsure how to do that.\\\\n  * Delete all source code from your laptop.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents.\\\\n  * Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup on your external drive and remove from your laptop. Please refrain from using iCloud for any files/repos.\\\\n* Dropbox\\\\n  * Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.\\\\n* Touch ID (optional)\\\\n  * Unlocking your device can be compelled at US border crossings, but other countries may be less intrusive, so it may make sense to make your device a little harder to unlock.\\\\n  * Disable Touch ID or Face ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: At Customs\\\\n\\\\n* Have ready your passport, visa/waiver, invitation letter, and travel details including the address of where you’ll be staying.\\\\n* Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.\\\\n* Common questions:\\\\n  * Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting in *city*.\\\\n  * Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with 37signals.\\\\n  * Where are you staying? Lodging name, address, phone number.\\\\n* Be straightforward and truthful. You’re legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Arrive\\\\n\\\\n* Let us know when you’ve arrived at your destination and have cleared airport security.\\\\n* Touch ID / Face ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Basecamp app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.\\\\n* 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to https://basecamp.1password.com/profile and click Disable Travel Mode. Next time you open 1Password, you’ll have full access again.\\\\n* HEY: Log back in on your device(s).\\\\n* Source code: Download and restore the archive of your git repos, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n* Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.\\\\n\\\\n### Checklist: When You Return\\\\n\\\\n* Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the US.\\\\n\\\\n## Any Questions?\\\\n\\\\nHitting a snag or have any questions?

       "     '{\\'file\\': \\'benefits-and-perks.md\\', \\'content\\': \"# Benefits & Perks\\\\n\\\\n## Health Insurance\\\\nDetailed information about all 37signals insurance policies and other benefits can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/vaults/5060979274).\\\\n\\\\n### Medical Insurance\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, medical insurance is provided through Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. The company pays 75% of the premium and the employee pays the other 25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\nEach pay period, you’ll see a payroll deduction for medical insurance:\\\\n\\\\n* Employee-only medical coverage: $76.93\\\\n* Employee-partner medical coverage: $160.26\\\\n* Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: $171.29\\\\n* Employee-family medical coverage: $254.61\\\\n\\\\n### Dental Insurance\\\\n\\\\nDental insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Vision Insurance\\\\n\\\\nVision insurance in the US is provided through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. Open enrollment is in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals, your coverage will end on the last day of the month of your separation date and you may be eligible for continued coverage after that (COBRA).\\\\n\\\\n### Health Insurance for Staff Outside the US\\\\nIf you’re outside of the US and pay out of pocket for private health insurance, you can request reimbursement for 75% of your insurance payments on your monthly invoice. Your monthly reimbursement is capped at the amount 37signals pays per employee per month on the US employee group plan. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for reimbursement.\\\\n\\\\n### Life Insurance\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers a $400,000 life insurance/AD+D policy to all staff through MetLife. The company pays 100% of the premium. You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and it’s terminated automatically on your final day of employment. Open enrollment is in November every year, and participants are auto-enrolled at that time.\\\\n\\\\n## Retirement Plan\\\\n\\\\nOur retirement plan for US employees is with Vanguard. 37signals matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 6% of your salary. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan with your first paycheck.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re outside the US, 37signals will match what you contribute to a retirement account in your home country, up to 6% of your salary. In these cases, 37signals will pay you directly via your monthly invoice. It’s up to you to invest that payment and maintain administration of the retirement account and its taxes. You may be asked to provide documentation to support your request for a match.\\\\n\\\\n## Flexible Spending Account (FSA)\\\\n\\\\nThe FSA is an account where you can set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as prescriptions, over-the-counter medicine, vision care, etc. You have to decide up front how much money you want to put in the account, and the max is $3,050/year. There is a separate type of FSA for dependent care, and the max for that plan is $5,000/year or $2,500/year if you split this with a partner. This is an entirely optional program. Open enrollment is in December every year, with new coverage beginning January 1. Both FSAs are with Paychex, our payroll provider.\\\\n\\\\n## Paid Time Off\\\\n\\\\n### Vacation Time\\\\n\\\\n37signals offers 18 days of paid time off plus [11 local holidays](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5061131347) every year. We ask that you [track your time off](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/projects/14971171). Your vacation time is prorated based on your start date during your first year at 37signals. Your vacation time rolls over year to year with a maximum bank of 27 days at any time. If you are terminated or resign from 37signals with vacation days in your bank, you’ll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (prorated at the time of your departure).\\\\n\\\\n### Sabbatical\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to annual PTO and holidays, every *three* years employees may take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Give your team a heads-up preferably three months in advance so they can coordinate. If you’re terminated or resign from 37signals with an unused sabbatical, 37signals will pay you the monetary equivalent of those unused days only if your unused sabbatical was earned within the previous 12 months.\\\\n\\\\n### Sick Time\\\\n\\\\nWe don’t offer a bank of sick days nor do we ask you to track your sick days. However if you’re unexpectedly away from work due to illness or injury for more than 5 consecutive work days, you’ll transition from sick time to Personal Leave. 37signals does not pay out for unused sick time upon resignation or termination, since we have no sick time bank.\\\\n\\\\nYour manager will check in with you if you’re consistently taking 3+ unplanned sick days per month. Excessive use of sick time may result in disciplinary measures. If you have a medical condition you know will take you away from work regularly, please work with your manager for accommodations.\\\\n\\\\n### Personal Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you are unable to work for more than 1 week because of illness or injury, let your manager know as soon as you can. You can take four weeks off at 100% pay. If after 4 weeks, you’re still unable to work, your salary will drop to 70% for an additional 8 weeks. Your medical insurance will remain in force throughout your Leave. If after 12 weeks, you still cannot work, talk to your manager, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis. You may be asked to provide medical documentation to support your request for Personal Leave, and Personal Leave is limited to one instance of paid leave per 12-month period.\\\\n\\\\n### Summer Hours\\\\n\\\\nWe work 4-day work weeks from May 1 through August 31 every year. An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible. When a holiday occurs during summer hours, you can take the holiday off *or* your normal summer day off. Any additional days off would count as vacation days.\\\\n\\\\n### Day of Service\\\\n\\\\n37signals also allows a Day of Service. You can take one day off every year to volunteer for a charitable or community organization of your choice. No need to use a vacation day or personal day, just let your team know you’ll be out. 37signals does not pay out for unused Days of Service if you resign or are terminated from 37signals.\\\\n\\\\n### Scheduling Time Off\\\\n\\\\n37signals doesn’t have a formal time off request process. It’s your responsibility to work with your manager and team to ensure coverage and manage your scheduled workload. The sooner you can inform your manager and team of your planned absence, the better, especially longer absences like sabbatical or long vacations. If your team has a defined process for scheduling time off, please follow that first.\\\\n\\\\nThe only time we ask you *not* to schedule discretionary time off is during a CODE. At 37signals, we assign a CODE when urgent work needs to be done. We have three levels of criticality. A CODE RED is an emergency, a CODE YELLOW is less immediate but still critical, and a CODE LAUNCH is called when we’re in the final stages of launching a new product. If we’re in the midst of one of these and you can delay your vacation or sabbatical until after the code has ended, please do.\\\\n\\\\n## Family Leave\\\\n\\\\nIf you become the primary caregiver of a child, you can take up to 16 weeks leave at 100% pay. If you become the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% pay. You may choose to take an additional unpaid leave as the primary or secondary caregiver.\\\\n\\\\nSome states require us to provide additional [benefits](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/stateFMLA.md#new-york).\\\\n\\\\n## Bereavement Leave\\\\n\\\\nWhen you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.\\\\n\\\\nYou can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave. And if you know you’ll be away from work for much longer than outlined above, please talk to your manager to discuss that special case.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\\\\n\\\\nThe 37signals EAP is through ComPsych, and it provides a *confidential* avenue for you to get assistance with issues regarding health, family, legal, financial, wellness or other personal matters. When you call or email ComPsych, you’ll be connected to a certified representative who can help you one-on-one at that time, or who can refer you to someone in your area for longer-term help. Services range from immediate or crisis mental health care to phone-help on your 401k investments to a referral to a lawyer in your area to help with your estate planning. Because we use the EAP, you also receive discounts on those referrals to professionals.\\\\n\\\\n## Pet Insurance\\\\n\\\\nFor your fur babies! 37signals doesn’t contribute to this plan at all, but everyone gets a 10% discount on this insurance you might otherwise buy. There are no set rates, and you can visit our portal on [Figo’s website](https://figopetinsurance.com) to get your quote and sign up. There’s no open enrollment period to sign up for pet insurance.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Profit Sharing\\\\n\\\\n37signals shares 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2022 profits distributed in March 2023).\\\\n\\\\nYou’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary at 37signals, and you’ll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nWe ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon, not something to be budgeted with, but as a true bonus. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount we’re able to share with employees may swing wildly or not be paid out at all.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Liquidity Pool\\\\n\\\\nThere are no plans to sell 37signals or take the company public! But, in the slight chance of that happening, employees may be eligible to receive a portion of 10% of the value of the company if 37signals is sold or made public. That 10% would be divided into shares, and shares distributed amongst employees based on their tenure at the time of the sale/offering.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees are eligible for shares in the liquidity pool after two years of working at 37signals. You’ll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary, and you max out your shares after 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.\\\\n\\\\nThis Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from 37signals before the distribution date.\\\\n\\\\n## Employee Gifts\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of every year, 37signals gives a thank-you gift to employees. The gift changes year to year and is not intended to be a year-end bonus.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees also receive a thank-you gift on their anniversaries with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Home Office Set-up\\\\n\\\\nSince you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. During your first year at 37signals, you can expense up to $2,000 on things like a new desk, new desk chair, or other office furniture. This benefit expires on your first anniversary with the company.\\\\n\\\\n## Coworking Space Stipend\\\\n\\\\nYou can expense up to $200/month towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you’re using a true coworking space that’s meant solely for working, not a club or social space like Soho House.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone at 37signals has a subscription to [Deskpass](https://www.deskpass.com), a co-working desk reservation service. You can use Deskpass to find co-working spaces near you, and your $200/month benefit is pre-fixed in your account. You’re not required to use Deskpass to use your co-working space benefit. Your Deskpass budget is capped at $200/mo, but none of that gets paid out unless you book a desk.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal 37signals Accounts\\\\n\\\\nAll employees can have a free personal Basecamp account and a free personal HEY account. We\\'ll comp your existing accounts during your on-boarding process when you join the company. If you decide to sign up for either account later, you can comp the accounts in QueenBee so you won\\'t be charged. Ping Andrea or Support if you need help with that.\\\\n\\\\n## Expense Account\\\\n\\\\nAll staff carry a 37signals Visa card that you can use for work expenses like the benefits described above, software, computer equipment, meet-up travel, or office supplies. Check with your manager or Andrea if you have any doubts about whether or not a purchase qualifies as a work expense.\\\\n\\\\nWe use an expense management platform called [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com/). You’re responsible for the monthly categorizing of your expenses and uploading receipts for purchases over $75. Full instructions on how to log your expenses in Airbase can be found in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/28168307/documents/5508145768).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a meet-up flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of 37signals, we’ll buy your meals. Just try to stay away from caviar and champagne at dinner (okay, maybe once if you have a great day to celebrate).\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of conferences — please limit your attendance at professional conferences to once a year. Don’t extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule; you should be traveling specifically to attend the conf. Our conference budget guidelines mirror our mini meet-up budget guidelines; you can find those in [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4347682694).\\\\n\", \\'similarity\\': 0.36408561018546237}',\n",

Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks.\\\\n\\\\n## Your First Few Days\\\\nBefore you start, Andrea will order you a new Apple laptop with the specs you request and any accessories you need like an external keyboard, mouse, or display. Get what you need, while keeping in mind the demands of your work when choosing specs.\\\\n\\\\nA day or two before you start, your manager will email you instructions for your first day.

We centrally manage and secure these devices with [Kandji](https://kandji.com/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.\\\\n\\\\nThis doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.\\\\n\\\\n## Access to code and secrets\\\\n\\\\nKnowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, Dash, our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, storing secrets, and connecting to the 37signals 1Password account must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.\\\\n\\\\n## Personal data on a work device\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s best to avoid mixing business with pleasure, so you must separate personal and work computer usage. Firstly, 37signals should not have access to your family photos, email, messages and personal files. Secondly, one high-profile hack after another is due to commingling personal and work use on a laptop that has access to sensitive systems. There are also hazards of exposing work to your personal data:\\\\n\\\\n* We may need to wipe a laptop remotely at any time and without notice. There should be no risk of destruction of your personal data if we do this.\\\\n* If there\\'s a hack and we need to do forensics or take a device snapshot, employees shouldn\\'t be saddled with sifting through someone else\\'s highly personal data.\\\\n* If we do malware or secrets scanning, we shouldn\\'t have to look at employee bank account details, government ID numbers and such that turn up in personal documents interspersed with work documents.\\\\n* If we need to turn over work devices to a government because of a lawsuit, your personal data shouldn\\'t be embroiled in any subsequent legal investigation.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, work computers are for work, so please make sure personal data and personal computer usage is kept to your own device.\\\\n\\\\n## Mobile devices, Windows and Linux\\\\n\\\\nDevices running Android, iOS/iPadOS, Windows or Linux are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not fine to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you\\'re coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a Kandji-managed Mac.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n\\\\nThere are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we\\'ve produced [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.\", \\'similarity\\': 0.3114470000656652}'],\n",

You’re part of the team!\\\\n\\\\nIn your first 90 days, you’ll be getting aligned with your manager on approach and expectations. You’ll get up and running, do real work, in real circumstances, with real coworkers, for long periods of time. It’s your manager’s responsibility to give you proper opportunities to demonstrate your skills and fit for the job. This includes your technical expertise, your engagement with coworkers, and your ability to take feedback and adapt to the 37signals culture. Similarly, it’s on you to take advantage of those opportunities, and to show that you’re capable of meeting the team standards.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start, you’ll receive an outline of expected performance metrics for your first 3 months. Those standards will be clear and attainable, and your manager will give you frequent, candid feedback. On occasion, despite our collective best efforts, it’s not a fit. We don’t do full-scale performance improvement plans during the first three months. So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won’t work out, your manager will let you know early and why.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase — you’re well suited for this job, this team, and you’re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren’t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!\\\\n\\\\n## Mastery & Titles\\\\n\\\\nAdvancing your career at 37signals doesn’t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake.\\\\n\\\\nWithin each of our job functions, we’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\\\\n\\\\n* Junior Programmer\\\\n* Programmer\\\\n* Senior Programmer\\\\n* Lead Programmer\\\\n* Principal Programmer\\\\n\\\\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\\\\n\\\\nBut these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role _at 37signals_. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a “Designer”. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: [Designers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-designers.md), [Ops](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-ops.md), [Programmers](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md), [Support](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-support.md), [Data](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-data.md).\\\\n\\\\n## Pay & Promotions\\\\n\\\\n37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don’t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group.\\\\n\\\\nSome jobs at 37signals are *not* matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a [$73,500 salary floor](https://m.signalvnoise.com/minimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000/) (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).\\\\n\\\\nThe Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we’ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to raises based on Radford market data, we’ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn’t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you’ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Reviews\\\\n\\\\nYou’ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you’re new to 37signals, you’ll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you’ll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they’ll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve.\\\\n\\\\nManagers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings.\\\\n\\\\n## Performance Improvement Plans\\\\n\\\\nIf your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you’re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we’d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we’ll follow our [performance plan process](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/performance-plans.md#performance-plan-process).\\\\n', 'similarity': 0.5408653975441997}\",\n",
