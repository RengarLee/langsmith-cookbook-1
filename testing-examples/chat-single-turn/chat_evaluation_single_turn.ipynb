                "Chat bots, designed to assist users or provide entertainment, typically engage in multiple conversational turns in any given chat session. Over extended interactions, there is potential for the quality of the LLM responses to diminish. This can manifest as difficulty in recalling earlier conversation details, improper interaction with external resources (if available), or repetitive and uninspired responses. If your current offline evaluations focus solely on individual question-answer pairs, such nuances may go unnoticed.\n",

Rather than complicate the evaluation with simulation-based methods, the technique outlined below simplifies the process: we treat each data point as an individual dialogue turn. When these are sourced from different stages of actual dialogues, they effectively capture the typical behaviors your model should exhibit.\n",
